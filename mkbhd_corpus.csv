s8Un0XB_8xk,OnePlus 2 Review!,13:59,"Hey, what is up guys? Um could be HD here, and this is the oneplus 2 company named oneplus phone name, the 2 1. 2. 1 2. So i've been using this device for the better part of a month about three weeks or so as my daily driver. So all the time - and I know a lot of people - get worked up over the flagship killer slogan that they use. What I'm just going to do is ignore all the hype and just look at the device itself, so the easiest place to start is the hardware and a lot of interesting decisions went into the hardware department for the oneplus 2, but they all came together to equal. A really nice phone that feels good in the hand and that's what's important, so it has a nice little weight to it. It'S a little on the bigger side of the scale as far as smartphones go, but it's nothing too extreme, since it's definitely not the biggest smartphone. With a 5.5 inch display, the metal band around the phone is really premium. It'S a huge improvement over the oneplus one, and it's this metal band alone that makes the phone feel like it's more expensive and I like, if they didn't, try to go super thin, like some manufacturers trying to one-up themselves, I guess but nothing wrong with being a Little thick dear, every smartphone manufacturer, ever if you're, using a large camera module, which you probably are feel free to fill out the rest of the phone's body with battery like this, it will not make the phone too heavy or too thick, and everyone will appreciate the Extra battery, thank you anyway. The shape with the oneplus 2 is just fine. It'S rectangular and sort of boxy in a way, but it fits in the hand nicely, and this phone is really easy to hold the sandstone black back, helps that too now every one plus two comes by default with this sandstone black back and the texture is pretty Unique it's a little bit rougher than last year's phone, I'm guessing for durability, but it still feels great and then the back is removable. So you can buy another back with a different material and drop that on for a different look and feel also with the removable back. You get access to the dual SIM card slot trays. No, I access to the battery or any expandable storage, but you do just get the SIM card slots now. This one also features a pretty unique switch on the left hand side, it's the alert slider, so you can switch between sound profiles on the phone without having to turn the screen on. So all the way down is all notifications. Half way up is priority. Notifications and all the way up is do not disturb mode pretty nifty switch, although I feel like this is upside down. If I wanted to flip all the way to silent, I feel like I would switch all the way down. I don't know I wish I could reverse the order in the settings now. Of course, this slider on the left means you have both your power and volume buttons on the right hand, side of the phone. This was a little bit annoying at first, neither one of them has ridges or anything. So you kind of just have to remember where the power button is, and you get used to it eventually. They'Re, pretty clicky tactile buttons, but it took about a week of using the phone to get it to feel natural and stop making mistakes. I pretty much hit the power button on the first try every time now, although there's also totally the option of the double tap on the screen to wake from sleep. If you want to use that now at the top of the phone is the headphone jack I kind of wish it was at the bottom, but oh well and then at the bottom of the phone you have the speakers and the USB type-c port. Now the speakers aren't anything special, it's not even a stereo speaker. All the audio comes from the right Grill, which is not very loud, and it's kind of easy to cover with your finger. It has these built-in audio profiles, which are nice. If you really want to tweak the EQs, but honestly, the quality of the driver has to be decent first I'll end up cupping your hand around that to hear it anyway. This is one of those spots where they're cutting corners and then there's a USB type-c port. Alright, so this is a new port for smartphones and it was given in this phone with the reasoning. This is the future and it totally is. But that means that here in the present it's actually a little bit inconvenient unless you have a 2015 MacBook or Chromebook pixel, you don't really have a bunch of USB type-c charges lying around and the one that comes on the box. The cable is a little bit short and you have to buy another one for your car and - and I don't know, is it really worth it? Here'S USB type-c in this phone broken down here are your pros, and here are your cons is a worth. It depends on how into the future. You are, I kind of miss fast charging, but the battery life here is good enough that I'm not charging in the middle of the day, so I'm down with it. The oneplus 2 also has a biometric fingerprint sensor in that home button and, as I mentioned in the original impressions, video that I did when the phone first came out, this home button does all the same stuff. A regular home button does except actually press down and move, it's not tactile. So it's basically like a trackpad, a glass surface that you can tap double tap or hold down to read your fingerprint and the fingerprint reading is pretty good. Now this phone has gotten. I think for software updates, since I first started using it and from the very beginning the fingerprint sensor was quick and it's only gotten quicker. I'M really happy with it. It unlocks my phone with pretty great accuracy. You can store up to 5 fingers if you want and it's an easy way to secure my phone. I find it to be just as accurate as touch ID all right, so fun fact. When oneplus first sent me this phone early before the launch day for that impressions, video you guys saw, they didn't tell me anything about the phone, they didn't tell me any of the specs. They didn't tell me any numbers, so I actually wanted to play a little game with myself. I just looked at the display and I wanted to see if I could figure out if it's a 1080p display or a quad HD display, just by looking at it, and I looked at it, I set my wallpaper. I got my icons and everything - and I guessed based on you know, looks pretty good. I'M gon na say that's a top notch yeah, that's that's a quad HD display. Of course I took a screenshot and I looked at it later and it's 1080p. So I got the idea and I you know I held it up to a Galaxy s6 and then, of course you can tell oh that looks way better with the AMOLED display and quad HD on the galaxy s6. But the point is this: is a great 1080p display one of the best in the business and that's pretty good for 2015, so there you have it just on the outside. This phone is kind of stacked in the hardware department. It'S at 5.5 inch 1080p display its excellent has great viewing angles: excellent brightness contrast and colors thin bezels to keep the footprint pretty manageable metal rails. The swappable sandstone back dual SIM card slots, a 13 megapixel camera with autofocus laser autofocus, which I'll talk about in a second at 3300 milliamp hour battery a fingerprint reader and alert slider, a USB type-c port. That'S a lot of great stuff, but, like I mentioned in that perfect smartphone video, the last video we tend to now measure smartphones by what's wrong with them, instead of what's right, so the worst parts about this hardware would be the weak speaker and the lack of Wireless charging and NFC now on the weak speaker, not a whole lot. You can do you can just set the EQ still. It sounds good enough to your ear and it just won't be very loud and the wireless charging also not a huge deal for me. If you can pick up a few USB type-c cables, you'll pretty much be good to charge wherever you want. No NFC, though, there's really no workaround for that and there's two types of people on that issue: number one: people who use NFC all the time: people who use mobile payments, Google Wallet for that type of person. This is a deal breaker. This is not the phone for you if you're the other type of person like me, where you don't use NFC all that often I mean I used it actually, once in a while to pair with my rx100 to wirelessly transfer photos not a huge deal. It takes a little longer to do Wi-Fi pairing now, but for that it's not really a big deal. Oneplus is argument is that there are more of that second type of person, so they decided not to include it, but I mean how cheap would it have really been. I mean not including a super cheap feature like NFC and a new smartphone, because people don't use it is kind of like building a car and not including reverse lights, because people usually drive forward technically true but evade come on now. The camera. On the back of the oneplus 2, I did an entire separate video about that was when I first got the phone a few weeks ago and I'll link that video right below that like button, I can pair it at length to a couple of other high-end smartphones And give some photo and video quality samples. Basically, it's a pretty good quality. Smartphone camera, that's capable of taking some great shots, but it's a little slow and it needs to continue to be improved with software updates. It'S a 13 megapixel omni vision, pure cell s, image sensor, the largest pixel size of any 13 megapixel camera, and it has optical image stabilization and laser autofocus. The laser autofocus is very fast as you'd expect, and the optical image stabilization for photos is very good. It takes some crispy low-light shots with a low, slow, shutter, speed handheld. So that's awesome, but it's kind of slow to actually take the shot. Getting the camera app open is pretty quick. I'Ve been mapped to a double press of the home button, just like a Samsung phone, so I don't need any camera shortcut on my home screen, but the time it actually takes to click the photo and actually taking it is too long and it's that slow every Time kind of discouraging for when you're trying to capture faster motion, but I think we'll see this continued software update. It'S that make this phone and this camera better. It'S already gotten an update and soon apparently it's going to get manual controls as well. So this camera can get better and speaking of software, the oneplus 2 is running its own custom, rom of near stock, android, oxygen, OS 2.0 or actually 2.1. And i really like it, it's quick. It'S clean, it's pretty close to stock Android, as you can see, and it's customisable in a bunch of ways that are genuinely pretty useful. You can rearrange the icons of the toggles on your quick settings to look exactly how you want them and remove the ones that you don't use. You can go into the dual SIM card, tray settings and use one SIM card for calls, and the other one for data or really whatever you want. You can take total control of how the SIM cards are used or you can just use one you can use on screen or off screen buttons. I choose off screen and then, of course you can choose what the hardware buttons do on a long press or a double tap of any of the buttons. So that's how I made the DoubleTap of the middle home button open the camera, and I also have a long press of that home button open Google nap, but you can map a whole bunch more stuff for shortcuts. If you want - and you can enable a system-wide dark mode and change the accent color throughout the entire OS, which can be pretty nifty, there's tons of stuff like this, you can customize LED notification. Colors, you can customize app permissions, tweak, animation, speeds, etc. I mean you can really dig in and get your hands dirty and make this phone work exactly the way you want it to the biggest new feature. They'Ve added on the home screens that that looks like the furthest from stock Android is called shelf, which I guess everyone has to have a screen to the left of the home screens. Now so you can go into the settings and enable if you want - and it's basically just a page with a list of your recent apps frequent contacts and then some widgets of your choice. It'S kind of neat: you can change the header image to whatever you want and any widget in there you can add of any size. I'M not sure how many people will find this useful, but this is another one of those things that one plus can add features to with a software update. So I guess we can be optimistic about its potential and performance throughout all of oxygen. Os was top-notch snappy, as some might say. This is, of course, thanks to you the choice of your Snapdragon 810 chip, super high-end, your four gigabytes of RAM and, of course, a 1080p display not having to push as many pixels as a 1440p display. So I'm a fan, this usually tends to be the case with near stock Android phones, it handles a ram. Well, it remembers a ton of recent apps and multitasking and moving around between apps and web browsing, and your typical use is perfectly fine, as you'd expect, with higher end stuff. Like gaming, there was of course earlier concern about the Snapdragon 810, not being bad, but overheating, and this phone this phone never got hot on me once I gamed plenty, I put a lot of hours into it, even if it is throttling to keep temperatures down. I'M not noticing any difference in performance or functionality, and that's what really matters here. Battery life was also pretty good. This is combining, of course, the 3300 milliamp hour battery, which filled out the space nicely and the near stock Android experience and the great RAM management and the 1080p display instead of 2k. All the stuff combines to give my use an average of about three and a half to four hours or a little over four hours of screen on time per day, which the way I use a phone since I know it's different for everyone that number for me. I would give B, which is a huge improvement from like the d galaxy s6. I was using earlier, but also not quite at the level of the champs like the oneplus one and the Droid turbo. It'S enough to get me through an entire day comfortably, but not much past, that also there's no power saving mode. So once you get down to like 5 3 2 % of battery, you probably just want to turn it off. So, at the end of the day, when judging oneplus 2 as a complete package, it satisfies my like 5 pillars of a great smartphone package, pretty well great performance, great camera, great display, great battery life and great build quality and it kind of nails. All of those. Now I'm used to using like six seven $ 800 smartphones as my daily driver. So when you turn around and tell me, this is a $ 389 smartphone for this version, that's pretty damn impressive and I'm actually really curious to see how the Moto X style will come in and compare to this one at a pretty similar price point. All I can say is I've had my sim card in this phone for the past couple weeks like I've said, and I haven't wanted to take it out now sure as a full time user. You notice a lot of things. I don't even really see. In other reviews, like the vibration motor in this phone is really soft. It'S like really weak for some reasons. So if you leave your phone in vibrate only mode, I missed a couple calls that way and some notifications, which is weird and stuff like some apps like relay for reddit and Phoenix, didn't really work that well on this on until the latest version of oxygen OS 2.0.1, which fix a lot of that stuff and even stuff like the home button, not responding a hundred percent of the time, probably two percent of the time. It takes me an extra pressed for it to register. But again, a lot of this is nitpicking and can be fixed with continual software updates. So the worst thing about this phone is how hard it is to buy one again, but I would really recommend it to people who are willing to jump through a hoop or two or twelve to buy one thanks for watching guys and talk to you guys in The next one peace """
LObJOc5u7sY,Jaybird X2 Review: Best Bluetooth Earbuds!,4:21,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kim PhD here, and these are the j-bird X 2's there are these Bluetooth earbuds, there's a sequel actually to the jaybird blue buds ex that I liked so much last year. So this is the review of them. It should be pretty easy. So the originals of these guys, the jaybird blue buds ex, were some of my favorite headphones like ever. I don't even use ear buds that much, but I would pretty much never leave the house without these they're Bluetooth, earbuds that lasts like forever on battery. They have great sound, they happen to be under 200 bucks, so I included them on my top 5 headphones under $ 200 list and a lot of people love them ever since now, there's a thing these came out like three years ago. So all the technology from the inside and out has improved in the last three years, so the J Brut X, 2's aren't really like a design overhaul or anything like that, they're more of a refresh of remaking the same product with new technology for 2015. So here's what's new with the jaybird x2 that rhymed okay, first of all, they're, not blue buds anymore. There'S no blue buds anywhere on the box, actually they're, just the X twos now and they do come in a few colors. So the originals were just black or white. The X 2's come in a variety of colors, my personal favorite, of course, being the red and black, which is called fire. This is everything that comes in the box, the headphones, the case, three different size, rubber ear tips and now new, three different size, foam, ear tips. So the soft foam is actually used to be an optional paid accessory. So it's nice that they actually include these for free as a part of the package. Now you also get the ear fins that help them stay in your ears and a tiny USB 2.0 cable. All you really need to do is get your Bluetooth device to play. Music from and you're good to go and you can pair with up to eight devices to this just one pair of headphones, the biggest improvement or actually, I think, the biggest change mechanically speaking - is actually the carrying case. So the original models carrying case was this sort of a hard clamshell design, definitely protective, but super annoying to open. The new case is a hard shell on the bottom, but then more of a flexible soft rubber on the side. So you can just pop off the top put your headphones or accessories in there and then, when you want to close that you just pop the top right back on when you're done. It'S a lot easier for me than that clamshell and the other big mechanical improvement for the j-bird x2s is the improved ear fins which are a bit more comfort, a little bit softer to help these things stay more securely in your ear when moving or running you Technically, don't have to use the fins, but they help the ear buds stay more firmly in my ear for keeping the seal and keeping the dope sound and speaking of dope sound. Yes, these do still sound awesome. This is again where new technology comes into play. You can fit better drivers into a smaller place. You can work on the sound profile of such a small pair of headphones. The Bluetooth connection is more reliable, etc, and they still have this really rich. Warm punchy sound, like a last version, super fun to listen to, especially for sports and stuff. They charge fully in about two hours and they still have that really long. Eight hour battery life and that might not sound like an all-day thing. But if you only listen to music for two hours every single day, that's going to last you almost a week and just the overall fit and finish is better here: there's improved water resistance. It feels like the connection with the cable of the earbuds is more solid and the soft touch finish is way better looking and feeling in the hand than the glossy casing of last year. So there's pretty much nothing. I don't like about this refresh, even if you've never used Bluetooth headphones at all before these would be a great first pair, considering they're super easy to use and pair and get started with, and then they're really durable. So if you do drop them or you play a rough sport or have a long practice or get them wet, they will survive. So when it comes down to it, there are no better wireless earbuds for the price and I've tried a lot of them. I just can't get past recommending these now. Here'S the bonus, the originals, the jaybird blue buds ex, which are still pretty good. Now they dropped in price. So it's like a new smartphone coming out. The older version drops in price a lot I'll leave the link right below. If you want to check out the original jaybird blue buds X and get it for a steal. I think they're now like way under 150 bucks now so that's pretty dope and I'll also be giving away a second pair of the jailbird X twos. So if you want to check out a pair of those stay tuned on Twitter, I'll leave, my Twitter link below some Twitter giveaway action will be happening. That'S basically it if you enjoy this video feel free to leave it a thumbs up. Thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace you """
9HDKRP4nzc0,Moto G 2015 Review!,5:32,"Hey what is up guys in qHD here? Alright, we have some pretty great smartphones already like the Moto X style and the oneplus 2 that are under 400 bucks off contract, but then the market for even less expensive smartphones under 300 bucks has heated up a lot in the past couple months: Alcatel OneTouch Idol, 3 Asus zenfone 2, the oneplus one has come down in price, so Motorola's response to all this is actually really important to them. Moto G is like their baby to the point where Moto G was their best selling smartphone of all time. So this is Motorola's real flagship, sure the Moto X style and the play will have higher end specs on paper, but the Moto G is the most important phone on Motorola makes right now. So this is the Moto G 2015 attempting to up the quality from last year and keep the price low so to get it out of the way the price actually there's two models, but starting at 179. So there's a $ 179 8 gigabyte model with 1 gig of ram or the $ 220 16 gigabyte model with 2 gigabytes of RAM. I recommend the higher-end model. That'S what I've been testing so technically a little over $ 200, so to keep the quality high and the price low moto essentially has a stripped-down version of their more premium phones. So there's plastic around the edges where there used to be metal, it's a little bit. Thicker and more rounded than other flagships and it's missing little things like 5 gigahertz, Wi-Fi or AC, Wi-Fi and NFC. Now, if this thing was being labeled a flagship killer or if it had a huge price tag, then those would be pretty head scratching, but it's not so it can forgive it. It still has some premium parts, though, because these are things that come down in price. Over time, so the Moto G has the exact same camera sensor from the Nexus 6, a 13 megapixel sensor, no optical image, stabilization and no 4k. Video, though so I wouldn't expect a lot from it, but still not bad. You also get a little dimple on the back of the phone which, yes again, I'm a really big fan of and the whole back is actually pretty nice. It'S textured in a nice way where these ridges aren't so deep that they catch dirt or anything but they're enough to give a nice grip in the hand and the phone doesn't slide off the table or out of your pocket, like some other flagships out there. It also has a removable back, and while the battery is sealed in, you do get a micro SD card slot again pretty good and if you make sure to click down all the spots on the back of the phone correctly every time. The Oh G is also ipx7 water-resistant, so for up to one meter of water for 30 minutes, which means it's good, basically, the handle splashes or rain, which is convenient. It'S also rocking a front facing speaker. Now. It'S not the stereo speaker that I love from the Nexus 6. It'S only on the bottom grille, but even at that, it's a front facing speaker if big, it's loud, it's hard to block by accident and it's much better than anything rear-facing or downward facing so I'll. Still take and other parts of the phone are more expected for this price, so it's rocking at five inch, 720p display pretty sure it's the same panel as last year's Moto G. So it's not the brightest thing in the world, but has okay viewing angles, and it's an IPS display. Nothing noteworthy here and inside is a Snapdragon 410, which is a quad-core chip and a 2470 milliamp hour battery, which is absolutely its best feature. The battery life on the Moto G is absurdly good. First of all, it might have the best standby time of any smartphone I've ever used, and that's saying something, and on top of that, I've never even gotten close to killing in a day and that's with my normal mkbhd use. I don't take it easy. I'M on Twitter all the time I get a lot of email plenty of video watching. You can expect six hours of screen on time easily out of this phone no problem, and the best part is if you have a light usage day, which, let's be honest, a lot of Moto G buyers will have. Sometimes you can just not charge it that night and have enough juice to go the entire next day without any worries. I basically love the battery on the Moto G. This is also pretty promising, I think, for the Moto X Styles battery, given it has the same software situation and didn't go the Snapdragon 810. So now the lightweight OS and the Moto G keeps the battery and the performance great. And while this phone doesn't exactly bench much a performance is just fine again, I'm speaking for the higher-end model here with the 2 gigabytes of RAM and handles normal use, some multitasking having a couple, apps, open, etc, all without really hitching or stuttering. Motorola is added a few features that may be useful if you decided to turn them on, but you can also disable them, although I didn't, since they pretty much, never triggered accidentally. So there's the double chop to light up the LEDs on the back here for a flashlight which, by the way, really shows off the plastic, build and the classic double twist for Motorola to open the camera. Other moto stuff flies in the app like recognising when you're sleeping or driving or like at a certain location and changing your settings accordingly. Honestly, this moto G is a complete phone for the price tag it has LTE. It has active display, even though it's not an oled display with no hit to the battery. It has an interchangeable back and, of course, if you want a little bit more color, you can change out for a new one. It doesn't have any major glaring things that you can point to and say: okay! Well, that's why this phone is so cheap. I mean, I think the display is, I guess, the lowest end part of the phone. It'S pretty dim and it's only 720p. But beyond that, you're getting a lot of bang for your buck here, especially being a water-resistant and having a front facing speaker and a decent camera and a legitimately incredible battery life. So basically, what I'm saying is, if I can use this 200 ish dollar smartphone. As my daily, with my use, when I'm used to like five six seven hundred dollar smartphones and get away with it, then it's more than enough for people who are only looking to spend 200 bucks. So yeah do you have it? This guy is basically top of the class for bang for the buck. Right now turns out. You can't really go wrong with moto G thanks for watching guys and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace """
cx20nTPZjes,Sony RX100 IV Review: Pocket 4K!,7:10,"Hey what is up guys? I'M could be HD here, and this is the sequel to the best pocket camera ever made two years running. This is the Sony rx100 mark for now. I'Ve already reviewed the rx100 mark 3 in detail last year, so I'll link that video right below the like button and if you guys already seen it, you know, I like that camera a lot. So the rx100 mark 4 will be basically a very familiar camera to people who have used any previous rx100 right. So the mark 2 here, as you can see it, had a hot shoe on the top. Then the mark 3, the next year, ditched that hot shoe for an optical viewfinder, and now we have the mark 4, which feature wise is like an enhanced version of the mark 3. So the new cameras rocking a stacked one inch 21 megapixel sensor as its biggest new feature behind the same 24 to 70 millimeter glass, and this sensor allows for things that make this camera a lot faster than previous generations. That'S the big difference. Autofocus for photos is blindingly crazy fast. You can now take photos with a 30 mm of a second electronic shutter. That'S really fast and you can out record video in full 4k and there's also now a high frame rate mode that allows you to record video at up to 960 frames per second. It also has a much improved electronic viewfinder, so if you flip it out and if you actually use this EVF you'll notice, it's right away a lot sharper than the last one. It'S actually kind of trippy when looking at, like a shallow depth of field shot through the viewfinder kind of looks like a VR headset, and it can actually now be disconnected from the power setting. So you can close the EVF without turning the camera off. If you want, and that famous ring around the zeiss lens on the front of the camera, is improved too, it's a little bit thicker a little bit smoother and overall, better built, and it can still be used to control things like aperture or zoom or even manual Focus if you wanted to and then you can't forget the articulating LCD screen, the pop-up flash that can be used to bounce light off the wall or the ceiling and the NFC and Wi-Fi chips inside to let you instantly transfer full resolution photos from the SD card To whatever smartphone you have so all this inside a metal body that can take a beating it's built like an absolute tank, I mean this is a seriously well rounded pocket camera. Speaking of SD cards, though you got ta mention you have to make sure you get the right one. Only certain SD cards will work with the 4k video other photos and stuff will still work, but you need specifically a uhs-i. You three compatible memory card to shoot. In 4k, I'll link, the one I use below to avoid confusion, the slow-motion stuff was actually really cool. I think at 240 frames per second, you can pull off some really cool stuff and even at 480 frames per second, you can really start to slow stuff down a lot and yet keep a lot of the quality sony says you're getting 720p video out of it, Though I think at this point we all kind of know that it's not quite 720p video, but it looks pretty good anyway, since it's so slow and then ah 960 frames per second gets to the point where it really doesn't. Look that good anymore I'd actually stay away from this, even though you can get it super super slow when slowing back down to 30 frames per second, it doesn't look anywhere near 720p and it's very noisy and grainy. So it's kind of a neat trick up its sleeve that you can record a few seconds at 960 frames per second, but I wouldn't use it all too much and I'd stick with the lower frame rates for the higher quality. But the one feature that I and a lot of other youtubers were really interested in when this camera was first announced was its 4k video and it looks really good. I love the 4k video that comes from the rx100 Mark 4. It can be seriously beautiful. None of that upscale 1080p or over sharpened over-processed, looking smartphone video. This is a huge step up from that, and it looks really good. It has optical image. Stabilization color is on point. Dynamic range is great and has a big enough sensor to get some shallow depth of field going. If you can give it a second to focus. This camera can give you like the best-looking videos, the best-looking vlogs, even in the business. I don't know how many bloggers care about quality like this, but the camera takes some seriously crispy video case in point. My entire last video about the moto x style was shot. You guessed it on the rx100 mark 4 and it was actually kind of the perfect application for it. It was all indoors where the light wasn't that great, but I shot an S log, so I could really push the images in grading without losing much quality and I don't know you'd much of a zoom range either inside. Since my subject is right in front of me, so if you enjoyed the quality of that video boom right, there is your six minute for halo light video sample, but is definitely not perfect. First of all, the autofocus during video is definitely slow. This is actually usually the typical experience here with shooting video with the rx100 and also sort of a bigger complaint of the previous ones and remains, if you're shooting, with a shallow depth of field. With a lot of subject, isolation and a blurred background, the camera can take a while to focus on objects that aren't faces also in this shot, thanks to Michael Fisher of PocketNow for being the model here, it basically refused to focus on the subject. I wanted it to. It was an autofocus mode. If I did go to manual focus, I would have been able to nail it, but it wasn't so. I had to scrap that shot and you're also limited to five minutes at a time of 4k video recording, but not for processing reasons or anything it's actually just because of heat. This thing makes a lot of heat when shooting a lot of 4k video and actually chews through battery really quickly. During this, this is the rx100 mark for, after just the first five minutes of 4k recording and in the middle of my third consecutive clip of doing this, it just shut down from overheating and refused to turn on for about 10 minutes. I actually dealt with this problem at the Motorola vent, literally standing there in the event playing with the phone just holding the overheated camera waiting for it to be able to turn on again. But then again, if it's making super-crispy videos like that, I can't even really be mad. So at the end of the day, this camera is really great, but not quite perfect. I would still put it as the best hybrid, like pocket video camera in the world for photos and videos, if you're into both, but as far as it being a thousand dollar video camera. It'S kind of hard to consider this, like the perfect YouTube camera. I know a lot of people have said like this. You know because it shoots 4k video and it has such a crispy. Image is basically like the perfect camera to buy to start a YouTube channel or even run a YouTube channel. You don't have to buy a thousand dollar camera to start, but if I would nitpick, I would say that this isn't the perfect YouTube camera because of the slower autofocus. Because of the fact that if you want to shoot in 4k, you're limited to five minutes and then it'll start to overheat, and if you want to shoot for long periods of time, you're. Basically, using this as a 1080p camera, which means you might as well get the mark 3 and then the fact that you can't use any audio inputs and the microphone that's built in, isn't all that great. You know, if I'm nitpicking for a thousand bucks, you could probably go with something like a DSLR I'll, try to link some other options below or even like. I said something like the rx100 mark 3, but I think this is one generation away from being something really incredible. I think that rx100 mark 5 is probably going to be able to next year shoot 4k video without overheating, without a 5 minute limit and might even have audio input, maybe if Sony's listening to us. So this is a pretty great camera to start good job Sony. I always thought the first pocket camera you've ever made, but uh looking forward to the rx100 mark 5. Already, thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace """
xpc07Lbgrow,GoPro Hero 4 Session Review!,6:35,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here and every single GoPro from the first one. All the way through to 2015 has been a rectangle until now. So this is the newest GoPro. This is the gopro hero4 session. I really want to like it, but here's what it's all about. So, first off, yes, it's a cube. It resembles that $ 99 polaroid cube camera except a lot less colorful, it's just all black all around. So the session is a one and a half inch cube. All the way around and has a big lens on the front and just two buttons. So it's a really simple camera to use kind of seems like a beginner GoPro at first, although it really isn't, but it just has one big record button up top and a little LCD display. And then the sides are pretty clean and behind the door on the left side is a micro, SD card slot and a micro USB port for charging and data which is kind of nice. It you can use your phone charger, unlike with other GoPros, that use mini USB and there's only one other button on the session on the back and that's the info, slash Wi-Fi button so lets you view the settings you're recording in or set up a Wi-Fi connection To your phone and that's it: oh, it has two microphones, one on the front top corner and then one on the back near the bottom button, but then yeah, that's it no other buttons, no removable battery, it's packed and all of this by itself out of the Box is fully functional and waterproof, and that is the main selling point. The fact that the fully waterproof gopro hero4 session is 50 % smaller and 35 percent lighter than a fully waterproof gopro, hero4, silver or black. So alright, it's a little bit smaller and lighter, but the other GoPros I already thought were already pretty small in light anyway. So what are the other differences between the session and the others? Well, first of all, since it's a square that means you can orient it any way you want in its mount. So if you want a side mounted on something, instead of top mounting, it doesn't require buying new accessories. You can just take it out and rotate it in its mount, put it back in sideways and boom you're good to go so that's actually really convenient, but then on the other side of the spectrum, not having any real display is kind of inconvenient. The small LCD on the top just displays your settings as you're recording, but in order to change any of your recording settings, you kind of need to have your phone with you paired with the GoPro app and that's where you can change. You know your video resolution or time-lapse speed or anything else like that. The GoPro app is really where all that stuff is found. It also works as a viewfinder with a pretty minimal delay, so that works really well. But when you're going out for like an adventure with a GoPro like this, you probably don't also have your not waterproof smartphone with you. So you'll want to pick your settings ahead of time, so you can leave your phone somewhere safe, so to record a video with the GoPro session. All you do is pick it up and press the red button on top wait a few seconds and then it turns on and just starts rolling, so press it again and it stops recording and then turns off. So there's no standby mode. It'S just either on and recording or off, and it does this actually to save battery, so I actually found it. It worked really well. The smaller battery in here lasted just as long as the hero4 silver, but then again that four second delay when trying to record the action when it was off, might also feel inconvenient if you're in the middle of something you don't have that delay on other GoPros. Where you can have it on, but not recording, you can also hold down the red button for three seconds to start a time-lapse with whatever interval you chose in the app with up to eight megapixel photos and the quality. Ah, the quality is okay, but it's definitely not as good as even the other GoPros or some of the other action cameras out there like Sony's or Panasonic's. It looks about as soft and muddy as you'd expect from any tiny handheld camera that maxes out at a widescreen 1080p. Not that 1080p is a bad thing. It'S plenty for most people, but it just doesn't look like a good 1080p colors are a little bit. Dull, dynamic range is definitely limited and it still has that super wide angle. Look people love, but it's not exactly team crispy and one might think that it would make maybe a really good vlogging camera, since it has the improved microphone for the underwater helping and it's a really super small form-factor. Then again, the gopro hero4 silver is the same exact price and as much better video quality and has switchable batteries. If you want to vlog for more than two hours of this battery lasts so again, it's kind of one up to buy his brother. So, that's why it's so hard to recommend this little guy. It'S not like it's a bad product or anything. It'S built really! Well, it's dense. It'S waterproof! This stuff works perfectly, but at 400 bucks it's not exactly cheap and at that price I start to also look for good video quality on top of just being well built. Here'S a shot I took with the GoPro Hero 4 silver, not even the black in 4k, but the silver which is the same price as the session and then the same shot with the session. It looks totally different. You can see in the side-by-side that you're clearly getting. You know, sacrificed in some detail with the session. Some people will care about this detail more than others, but it's not just detailed the color. It'S the exposure, it's a dynamic range and neither of these images is edited honestly. Looking through the session footage made me appreciate the gopro hero4 black, that much more turns out. That thing is a seriously impressive camera with a killer image for 500 bucks, and we already knew that, but the comparison makes it way more clear and on the hero4 silver is a great buy for the same price as a session 400 bucks. So, at the end of the day, got me thinking who are these GoPros for who is a session for I originally thought it was sort of like a beginner GoPro. You know it's smaller lightweight, waterproof tout the box. You just get to go with this and then, if you want to step up your game later, you pick up a regular GoPro, but at a $ 400 price tag for this one. No, so basically, this is just better for water sports things like water, skiing or like swimming, where it's attached to you underwater or I guess when it really needs to be light and weight like like when you're, maybe attaching it to a pet or something where they'll Notice, the weight of a larger GoPro, and even for that, the regular GoPros are still pretty good and for everything else, I'd still recommend the regular GoPros or even other action cameras. So there you go. That'S basically it thanks for watching. This is a gopro hero4 session. Feel free to leave a comment or hit that like button. If you enjoyed talk to you guys in the next one peace, you """
orPHNS-0CZI,iPod Touch 2015 Review!,4:53,"I totally meant to do that hey what is up guys, I'm cubby HD here and we finally have new iPods. You might not be able to tell unless you were following this stuff. In fact, you wouldn't even see it if you went to apple.com it's not on the tabs up top, but it's a 2-year old long overdue refresh of the new ipod touch - and this is everything you need to know - that's new about it. So first new thing is the updated specs. So this new iPod Touch is rocking an Apple a8 chip and 1 gigabyte of RAM, and this was the most needed part of the refresh. So now the benchmarks are a little bit below the current iPhone, which is great and performance. All around is zippy and smooth. Just like the experience on a fresh, iPhone or previous iPod touches, as you would expect, we all know iOS handles 1 gigabyte of RAM pretty well. So it's still smooth and even gaming is great on this iPod and actually think that's where it's going to end up being the best reason to buy this. I wish the screen was a little bit bigger, but while a lot of us, 90's kids grew up with Game Boys and PS PS, I can see someone buying this in 2015 as their first handheld gaming console, so think about that. Now, speaking of the display, that's actually the second major new thing, so it's rocking a 4 inch Retina display so 11 36 by 640, at 326 pixels per inch, nothing too crazy! Here, like I said, I wish it was a little bit bigger, but you know for watching videos and gaming. It'S alright and again, it's still an iPod. So it's a media player. It'S something want to keep small and portable and believe me, they have done exactly that. This thing is still super thin and light at 6.1, millimeters, thin and 88 grams, but it's still solid as a rock still so no bendgate issues here. The iPod Touch is built very well and in this really thin body, they managed to fit two other new pieces of hardware. First is the very slightly larger battery. This newest one is rocking 1043 milliamp hour battery, where the last iPod Touch was a 1003 milliamp hour battery. So just a little tiny bit bigger, but you'll actually see more of the battery life improvements thanks to new software and the new specs and the other thing. That'S new is the new camera so now you're set with a new 8 megapixel camera with an F 2.4 aperture, it's essentially on par with the iPhone 5s camera. In fact, I think a lot of the parts like the camera here and the display come from the iPhone 5, so was top of the line a few years ago. Now it's come. A lot down in price, makes sense for Apple to finish out the stock of these parts, so the photos and videos will look pretty good and yes, it does protrude a little bit from the back. I wish it didn't, but oh well. Lastly, one thing: that's not actually new is the home button, which is kind of disappointing, since that means there's no touch ID and also there's no NFC, so no Apple pay, no unlocking your phone with your fingerprint, no touching it to pay for apps, etc. Kind of wish it would have been there would have been nice to have, but it's not here just a regular home button also that strap that used to be connected to the back of the iPod to hold it to your wrist. That'S gone too. So it starts at 200 bucks even for the 16 gig and I think that's a pretty good start. Even the 32 gig is probably a good deal, but I think once you go over that you're getting into iPhone price territory. So at that point, I'm probably not recommend it I'd actually say to get an iPhone. I also highly recommend this blue color, but it also now comes in silver, gold, Space, Gray, pink and red. So there you have it it's that simple. That'S the 2015 ipod touch at the end of the day, it's kind of hard to say who exactly this is for like who the typical customer of this is, but it's basically someone who wants an iPhone but can't have an iPhone so wants to get all the Same experiences, like it kind of reminds me of my nerd cousins they're about 10 years old right now. She got up to John and RJ. If you're watching this, they can't have an iPhone right now, but they still can get something like this, which is a lot cheaper and has pretty much all the same pros of iOS and all the games and apps that they like. So that's essentially who it's for so there you have it. Thank you for watching this video. If we hit that like button below, if you enjoyed or even better there's a subscribe button below that, if you want to see more videos like this also uh, I don't need this one anymore. I have an iPhone that I used and I was in Apple music on it, so I don't need this iPod, so I'm gon na go ahead. Give this one away so it enter to win this exact ipod below that. Like button there's a comment section: if you're a subscriber just go ahead and leave a comment, letting me know, you want to win and I'll pick one random winner from anywhere in the world in one week and announce that winners name on Twitter so got and stay Tuned there, that's it thanks for watching and good luck.

TA8JprZlDYA,2015 Macbook Review!,8:13,"Hey what is up guys, I'm qHD here - and this is the 2015 MacBook - the new MacBook review. This laptops been out for a little while now, and people have made their choice if they want to buy it or not. But I still wanted to give my thoughts and my impressions of it since I've been using it for a bit and just let you know what I think of it as it exists now, so right off the bat. The number one reason that this machine exists and the biggest advantage it has over any of its competitors is this thinness and lightness. It'S the most portable laptop I've ever used by a long way it measures in at just 35 millimeters at its thinnest point and 135 millimeters at its thickest point, and it weighs in at just 2.03 pounds which is about as much as two iPad Air's. The two main sacrifices Apple had to make to get this thin are the keyboard and the trackpad, which are really your main ways of interfacing. With the laptop the trackpad, which initially seems like a workaround just to fit into the thinner body, it turns out to actually be one of the laptops best features. So, instead of the normal physical diving board mechanism that works for most laptops, the MacBook instead has a solid piece of glass that doesn't move. Then it simulates the sensation of clicks with a vibration motor and it's very convincing. So it feels like you're clicking a normal quality trackpad, even though it's not normal as a bonus. You also get this click sensation, basically everywhere on the glass, so not just the middle, like normal laptops and you get a different functionality for different levels of pressure, which is where the named force touch comes in. So force touch acts as a sort of a more info button, letting you like scrub through media or get definitions of words that you force touch in Safari and stuff, like that. I didn't use force touch stuff all that much. But overall I definitely liked the trackpad on this laptop. The keyboard, on the other hand, is definitely something I don't like in this super thin laptop Apple switched from normal chiclet style keys, which are on like every Apple keyboard for the past few years. To these butterfly switches, which are to make them thinner, but that also means there's almost zero travel. 0 click enos, it's a very mushy unresponsive, keyboard and I'll, be honest after a few weeks actually did get used to typing on this keyboard, and I stopped messing up in double pressing letters so many times, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed it, but at least it's Possible to get used to it, but the other thing is it's also not a standard keyboard layout, as you can see by the arrow keys all crunched together literally the one upside of this keyboard is that it's backlit and doesn't look terrible, but hey all in the Name of thin and light also, it was apparently a bit too thin for a normal sized webcam, because we got this 480p webcam in the new MacBook doesn't look terrible, actually ad. That looks awful anyway, aside from the keyboard and the trackpad, this is a really nice. Well, built quality notebook as it should be for the price. The display in particular is awesome. It is a crispy Retina display and has a resolution of 23:04 by 1440, which probably seems a little bit weird at a 16 by 10 aspect ratio. But that just means it's able to switch between a couple of scaled resolutions that affect the size of things. On the screen - and it can be a pretty bright display for a normal viewing or video viewing or gaming, but it also gets pretty dim for dark environments too. Another thing that's awesome, right below the display. Is this speaker just holy? It'S really good. Like best speakers, I've ever heard in a laptop good. I don't know how they did that, but this thing sounds 50 times its size. It'S amazing and yeah. The rest of the laptop is just you know, metal with the classic Apple modern, laptop aesthetic. So the baseline for this machine, which I got here in Space Gray, is 1,300 bucks and it's rockin. A 1.1 gigahertz Intel Core M 8 gigs of ram 256 gigs of storage and intel's integrated graphics. So clearly, not a powerhouse at all, and the computer itself like inside this body, is actually about the size of an iPhone. And it's lodged right up near the speaker. The rest is just battery just filled with battery every bit of space. It'S fanless, so it's dead, silent, no vents at all might get a little bit warmer, but it's just computer and battery apple claims 9 hours of battery life. I found I got more like 6. Of course, I'm using Chrome not Safari, so that's probably a big enough hit right there, and if you try to do anything much heavier than web browsing you'll run up against a wall. Pretty quickly definitely want to be plugged in. For that, so it's so thin and light that I actually find myself using this. In fact, more often lately in places where I would usually have used my tablet, so it fits in the same compartments as my nexus 9 and my iPad. It'S only a little bit bigger than them, but it's just as lightweight essentially, and it's got a way better display has a keyboard. It'S got way more functionality built in so it may seem a little bit weird to think of it this way, but this has been an awesome tablet replacement. So if you've heard of this laptop before now, then surely you've heard about its infamous one port. It'S single port on the side. I hope you liked dongles in hand, but at least it is USB type-c. So us BC is one of the most versatile at least one port solutions. You could possibly have I sort of like to have had two or three. Maybe one on each side or something like that, but for now it's not that difficult to adapt to and you still do have to adapt to it. But there are some adapters. Obviously, in dongles Apple makes some like $ 80 dongles. It would kind of suck. If you lost one of those but there's also some cheaper third-party ones, but anytime you want to plug in any accessory beyond just power or something like a mouse you're going to have to get an adapter. So I did get a bluetooth mouse. So I don't have to use a dongle for that, but anytime I want to do something past charging like plug it into a printer or a monitor or something like that or just reading an SD card. You need that dongle. The USB C port also allows you to charge up with a portable battery pack, if you're in a pinch, but that is pretty slow. So charging with the included USB C charger takes about two hours and the only downside is there is no charging LED light. Like you have on a MagSafe charger, but really the fact of the matter is I found myself using this machine. A lot like I was using a tablet, or at least I was using in a lot of the same situations as a tablet. So I didn't really compare it in my mind to other laptops, even though it's 1,300 bucks, and even though it's shaped like a laptop, I still compared it to a tablet. So the fact that it only had one port didn't really bother me. I didn't use it in many situations where I needed more than one port and the fact that it has a mushy keyboard. Didn'T really bother me because, basically, every solution, adding a keyboard to a tablet, has the same problem. Battery life would have been better on a tablet actually than this, but not to make excuses for the thing, but it makes an awesome tablet replacement. That being said, if you plan on using this all the time as a main laptop, you might want to consider spending your 1,300 bucks in a more power-hungry or power in place like you can get a MacBook Air right now or plenty of other fin and light Laptops that aren't quite as beautiful and elegant as this one, but we'll get you more bang for the buck in that department, but as far as the things that I use this for this actually turned out to work really. Well, so I'm not afraid to say it. I really like the new MacBook and a lot of ways. It reminds me of a super premium. Tablet experience it's silent. It'S fast, it's got an awesome display. The only thing that's stopping it from being like my main laptop, is the fact that I do do more high intensive things on my laptop that require more performance like video editing, photo editing, audio editing. Those are the types of things that might require the word pro at the end of the name, but if even if you're just looking at something like this - and you have 1,300 bucks to spend, you could still just get a MacBook Air. So this is a beautiful awesome machine, but you probably shouldn't buy it, and that being said, the second generation of this this is a first gen product, is undoubtedly going to be a lot better and a much better Buy. Now, if you've made it this far and you're still thinking that this is the laptop for you at least keep this one thing in mind: it's not upgradeable in any way. You can't really get into this machine and upgrade anything so when you do get it upgrade. The RAM upgrade the storage make sure you have enough to last you as long as you plan on using this thing, but that's basically it it's one of my favorite laptop. So that again, you probably shouldn't get same thing. I kind of said about the Chromebook pixel either way. Thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next video peace you """
UrzhzCA1NUw,HTC One M9+ (& S6 Plus!),4:10,"All right, so, if the HTC One m9 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 had a baby yeah. This is what we'd get. This is the HTC One m9 plus. So okay wait a second. We have the HTC One m9 that we see in stores. Everyone knows that, but what is this Plus version? In short, it's just a slightly better version of the flagship, that's already out, as the name implies. So, okay check this out. Here'S a couple of new additions number one, a slightly larger 5.2 inch, quad HD display. Yes, 2560 by 1440, so it's 0.2 inches, larger and also brighter and sharper than the 1080p display in the regular one m9. It'S also a little bit slightly cooler and color temperature, but overall the superior display and then at the bottom, as I'm sure, you've already noticed on the front here is a fingerprint sensor. So, just like the Samsung or Apple flagships, you can now register a couple of finger prints to unlock the phone. Just by touching your finger to the sensor, so no swiping necessary, it's actually really good. For me, it's been just as fast and accurate as the one in the Apple or Samsung flagship phone. So it's actually not a home button. It doesn't press in at all it's just a surface that looks like the Samsung home button, but you can't actually wake the device by tapping it. You'Ll have to either double tap the display or use the actual power button on the side of the phone to get in and the actual software home button to go home. But once you do get in it's the exact same software experience as a regular one m9. With just a few differences, thanks to it actually being for the Chinese market, which I'll get to in a second inside, it's pretty powerful too it's rocking a 64-bit, octa-core 2.2 gigahertz chip and three gigabytes of RAM. Again, it's not the Snapdragon 810 or anything. But it is packin a lot of power here and curiously enough, even though it is a little bit of a bigger phone, it does still have the same sized battery. So it's still rocking a 2840 milliamp hour battery like the regular one m9. But the last big difference here is around the back and it's the camera or cameras. It'S rocking a 20 megapixel sensor again this time with the round housing instead of square, and you have your dual LED flash and then up top. You have your depth sensor again that one from the One m8 of last year, so the m9 doesn't even have this at all. Now you can take your photos with all the glory of 20 megapixels and also still have the choice between some of HTC's corny duo. Camera effects not saying they'll, be pretty photos, but hey the effects. Are there so either way? It is a slightly larger phone. It'S a slightly different phone. It'S pretty comparable to hold on the hand, still has the same button placement as the original One m9, but everything else is straight from that already popular flagship, so from the excellent build quality to the pretty much unmatched boom sound speakers. So this brings to mind what we saw with the prime phones of last year. We had this self named LG g3 prime and the Samsung Galaxy s5 prime, and I did a video about both of those sort of explaining what Prime phones are and the same applies here. This HTC One m9 plus is another one of those phones. That'S only going to be sold in China and if you want to get any in your pocket, you'll have to import it, which comes at a cost of its own shout-out, to D brand skins for helping out with that, and yet it has its own optimizations. For that market, because as far as HTC is concerned, this is what the Chinese market wants, and the one m9 we see here in US stores is exactly what the US market wants. Now, I'm not saying I disagree with that, but I'll tell you right now. I would have loved to see the one m9 plus in stores here, considering that it's basically objectively a better phone than the one m9. In a couple of ways. Also, there have been rumblings of a samsung galaxy, s6 plus and, as far as I know, this photo, which was given to me by an anonymous source, is the first one on the Internet of that. So there's your exclusive and it'll have some pretty similar excellent specs and be a sort of a super-sized version of the original Galaxy s6. So there you go plus is the new prime thanks for watching guys and I'll talk to you in the next one peace. You """
VTUDzrIgZlI,LG G4 Review!,11:29,"Hey what is up guys in cabbie HD here and the LG g4 has been killing it. This is LG's big and bright and slightly curved flagship smartphone for 2015. For most of my phone reviews, you'll notice, it's pretty much a combination of the pros and the cons about the device, the pros being things that I really like about it, and then the cons being the list of things that I think could be a little bit Better and going through all the things I've written down and all the notes I have about the g4 during my time, using it, it's mostly pros. There'S not a lot, that's wrong with this phone at all and it pretty much checks all the boxes. In terms of things, you'd want to see in a high-end smartphone anyway, let's get into it. First of all, on the spec sheet, the g4 is high-end. All the way across the board you saw at the date was announced. So it's rocking a six-course Snapdragon 808 chip. 3 gigabytes of RAM and it benchmarks a little bit lower than that Snapdragon 810. But that's not a big deal, definitely still an excellent performer and the rest of the components like the display and the battery and the camera as you'll see in a second are top of the line too. But let's start with the build, since this was actually my least favorite part of the phone. It has a 5.5 inch display. So it's kind of a big phone and it's slightly curved, so not flexible curved like the LG G flex 2, and it grew its forehead back from the g3 which had those trademarked, much thinner, bezels. So I'm saying the g4 is not the prettiest phone in the world, but material choices are decent, so you get a glossy metal sides and you can get it with a variety of different backs, but that I have here is the plastic one. Lg says this is a plastic infused with metal, but I can't really tell so I'm just gon na call it plastic and it has a sort of a diamond pattern to it that you can feel when you rub your hand on it. There'S another back material. That'S ceramic a bit heavier and a bit smoother, but with the same diamond pattern and there's also a bunch of leather ones which actually look really nice. And although I don't know how durable they are, I still think I would prefer those over this plastic, but either way. Even if you don't get the back color, you like you, don't need to sell it or return it, because the g4 is part of an endangered species of smartphones that still have a removable back. So you can remove the back and replace it or use any of the other ones you can switch between them and underneath that removable back, you have access to a removable, 3000 milliamp hour battery and a micro SD card slot for expandable storage. So that will make some people really happy. Also LG kept all the buttons on the back of the phone, so there are no buttons on either side, it's nice and clean, and you have some slightly improved, more tactile buttons. I think they're a little bit more separated and the power volume up and volume down really easy to press and easy to get used to. I actually found myself reaching for back buttons on other phones after using this one. Now around the front of this phone is a 5.5 inch. Quad HD display again it's not an OLED display like Samsung, but it's what LG calls a quantum IPS display not to be confused with an actual quantum dot display found in some new TVs, but they do promise it'll bring some deeper contrast, blacker, blacks and better overall Color and yeah pretty much any way you painted this display looks awesome. It gets very bright, not quite as bright as the galaxy s6 again outdoors, but it's close and, of course it's super sharp and very vibrant and colorful and beautiful and curved, and just enough to make a difference when you're holding it up to your face. If you still make phone calls, so it might not be the dis best display in any smartphone, I'm still gon na hand in that crown to the galaxy s6. But the g4s panel provides a fantastic media experience if only it weren't paired with a bottom rear-facing, not that great easy to cover speaker it's kind of loud, but it really does the display a disservice whether you're watching your team dominate during the regular season or watching Them crumble to an epic postseason collapse so when it comes down to actually using this phone, we're rockin android 5.1 with LG's UI on top the software experience is sort of like a refined version of what we had on the g3. It'S a little bit cleaned up. A little bit smoother and it adds a few pretty useful features. Actually, some of them, notably copied from rivals but hey at least they copied the good stuff. I personally still prefer stock Android over this skinned version, but that's mostly for aesthetics and for a lot of people that matters less, and there are a bunch of neat features in here to make the g4 worth more. So, for example, besides the few pre-installed apps and widgets, you get that resizable LG keyboard, which i think was pretty underrated with the g3 last year. So if you have smaller hands, you can shrink the keyboard down to match or bigger hands. You can make the keyboard bigger if also brought in Samsung's dual window. You can take advantage of that whole five and a half inch display by multitasking with apps that support this again. It'S not something I use very often, but it's still neat to see. Even if we've seen it before it works pretty well, they also have these new smart features which use context like location and connectivity status to basically automate stuff. So I have mine set up, for example, to open Spotify. Every time I plug my headphones in, which is pretty convenient and you can have a change and open things like when it connects to your home, Wi-Fi or when you turn bluetooth, on, etc and then everything else in LG's launcher is pretty smooth and clean. I mean again it's not as clean as stock Android, but it's a definite improvement and I noticed things like you know: the super wordy version of the weather in the stock weather widget again like instead of the temperature, I get a paragraph or the settings. I still think are downright ugly, they've organized it really well and it's helpful, but any menu that needs the scrolling text was probably not planned very well, but honestly, that's just nitpicking and performance throughout this version of Android on the g4 has been extremely solid gaming great Web browsing has been very smooth on Chrome multitasking, with a bunch of apps open the g4 handled pretty much everything as it should with three gigabytes of RAM. Now on to the battery life of the LG g4. Like I mentioned earlier, it has a removable back, so the easiest quickest way to replace her charge is to just crack it open, take the battery out and replace it with a fresh one that you've charged somewhere else. That'S the easiest way to get your charge back and that's only possible because it's a removable, backed phone now when we first got the announcement. We also heard that it did not support Qualcomm quick charging and did not support wireless charging. Since that video one of those things has changed. It'S gotten an update now where it does support Qualcomm's, quick charging. So that's pretty nice, so you have battery swap available. You have quick charging available, still no wireless charging, but the battery life of the phone itself. With this 3000 milliamp hour battery is great. I'Ve been getting great standby time and great on screen time, so I typically average around 4 hours of screen on time with the quad HD display and all of its great performance and also standby time was really good. So I would go to sleep unplugged at 100 % and I would wake up with 98 percent battery left, which is great. You don't see that from every phone, so I'm happy to say that the g4 has been great in any aspect of battery life, even though it does get a little bit warm sometimes, even though it does have a really high-resolution really big display. There have been no problems, and it lasted me all day every day now on to the camera on the back of the g4. Since this thing has launched, this camera has been one of the most talked about. One of the most impressive features to a lot of people. This has been the thing: that's blowing more people away than anything else, and rightfully so. On paper, we're looking at a 16 megapixel one over two point: six inch sensor with a wide open, F, 1.8 aperture, which is the widest on any smartphone so far, and an LED flash that you'll hopefully never have to use. Also to the left of the sensor is your laser autofocus for fast and accurate, focusing and to the right under the flash? Is a new color spectrum sensor for fast and accurate white balance. The camera software itself is pretty clean, so you can double tap the volume down button on the back of the phone when it's off to open the camera, but I wish it didn't take a photo every time. I did that, but when you open it, you can see the auto mode looks like any other smartphone camera, a separate button for photos or 4k video quick focus thanks to the laser autofocus and tap to focus and meteor work pretty well. Overall, it's pretty easy to use for anyone who's trying to set it up, but then the g4 has a few tricks up. Its sleeve first is the new manual mode, similar to the galaxy s6, and it's pro mode here. You can choose everything, just like a DSLR from ISO to white balance, to shutter speed to the manual focus, distance and dial in that perfect shot and then there's even a toggle to switch to shooting RAW images which you can actually take into Lightroom or Photoshop and Tweak the data yourself just like with a DSLR shot, so that's really impressive. So on to the actual images on a beautiful, quad, HD viewfinder, it's easy to be very impressed by the crispy photos. The g4 takes there's tons of detail, great colors, even pretty decent dynamic range, which is impressive for a smartphone camera, but yeah bringing them into a computer and inspecting them. Actually, that left me more impressed pretty much. Every photo I took was clean and intact sharp focus and it very quickly became one of those cameras that made me want to just go out and take more photos of things. Just encouraged me to point and shoot in auto mode, and it did a killer job. Also, the optical image stabilization had me taking way more low-light shots and a did great job with those two dynamic range was wide enough to keep those photos looking pretty balanced, even in more extreme situations and the O is kept shots crispy, no matter what the conditions. Basically, what I'm saying is it's very hard to complain about anything about the G for camera, but I do have something just one little nitpick as much as we love crispy shots. The g4 does actually over sharpen a little bit the same way. Samsung phones did one or two years ago take this shot. For example, I took the same photo on both the Galaxy s6 camera which you I've talked about that phone a lot in this video and the LG g4 camera. Both shots looked fantastic on the phone's display, but inspecting them both on the computer and zooming in the g4 photo was so much sharper than the galaxy s6 is to the point where I thought I actually missed focus with the s6 camera, but I didn't the g4. Just sharpens the image a lot more on post-processing, so you can see it's crispier, but it's not actually showing any more detail. The issue is a little easier to see here in this photo, so the gnome is in focus, but some of the flowers aren't supposed to be. But if you zoom in and look at those flowers, you can see they're still processed in a way that kind of tries to find detail and crunch into focus things that aren't not a huge deal, especially when most people never zoom in on their smartphone photos anyway. But this is something that can be adjusted in a software update and I think that's what we'll see. Otherwise, though, don't let me ending on that note, give you a bad taste. This is easily one of the best cameras in any smartphone on the g4, and I might not be able to replace your DSLR like LG might want you to think it does, but damn we might need to have another top smartphone cameras comparison pretty soon, oh, and If you're wondering it also has a front-facing, 8 megapixel selfie camera in case you're into that so overall, at the end of the day, the g4 is an awesome phone in a lot of ways. I think my biggest problem with it was just aesthetics like I didn't think it was a prettiest phone. I really like the way the g3 looked with the super thin bezels on the sides and the top. The g4, I think, is a little more boring. In my opinion, maybe if I had the leather version, I'd be a little bit happier about the way it looked, but not a huge fan of the plastic, not huge fan of the sides that are kind of metallic but still kind of slippery. But otherwise it's an awesome phone like the camera, the performance, the battery life, the specs just the hardware in general. It'S an awesome phone in pretty much every other way to use, and I think you'll be happy with it. It'S especially if you like the g3. This is gon na, be an awesome phone to pick up so yeah. That'S hope you enjoyed this video review of the LG g4. Thank you for watching and if you enjoyed it, feel free to give it a thumbs up below and hit that subscribe button.

dPL1-8ypnEs,Apple Watch Review!,7:10,"Okay, so this is the Apple watch. This is Apple's first attempt at wearable tech, and this is everything you need to know about it. First of all, there are three versions of the Apple watch: Apple watch, sport, Apple watch and Apple watch Edition, and the only difference between these three versions is the materials that they're made of and the bands also every watch comes in two sizes, a 38 millimeter and The 42 millimeter not that much of a difference in number, but most likely a men's size and a woman's size, but do note that the 38 is extremely small and a lot of women will actually go with the 42 anyway. The Moto 360, for example by comparison, is a 46 millimeter diameter. So for the record, I'm using a 42 millimeter Apple watch with a classic leather band, which does mean the watch you're. Seeing in this video cost $ 700, that's as much as an iPhone. So for 700 bucks you do need to stand out from the crowd and be noticeably better than the rest of the smart watches out there, but does it do that? Okay? Well, first of all, there are a bunch of different band options, since the band on the Apple watch, one of its best features is that it's easily interchangeable and you can buy any of Apple's, pretty expensive bands. Or there are some third party bands that are starting to pop up to, but smartwatches in general are supposed to show you notifications from your phone means. You have to take your phone out, your pocket less and then anything extra is a bonus. So here's how the Apple watch works. You have the touchscreen on the front and then two physical buttons on the side. One is a knob called digital crown that also presses in as a button, and then the other one is a much more tactile button, but the digital crown is a bit softer kind of requires you to squeeze the whole watch to press it. Neither of them are customizable, so you can't map them to functions. You use more and then on the screen. You have your watch face and if you press the digital crown button, you get brought to all your watch apps and these I'll get to in a second from the watch face just like on the iPhone you swipe down to view all of your iPhones notifications, where You can clear one at a time or just clear them all, which is actually really nice and then there's this swipe up from the bottom into. What'S called glances and glances. Are these little cards with glanceable information kind of like Google now cards, and they come from the apps that you have installed on your watch? So they can give you all kinds of info with a single swipe also gives you music controls for iTunes or Spotify, or whatever you use, and even the shortcut to toggle airplane mode or pin your iPhone to find it if you've lost it. Alright, so your apps, where do they come from so the apps on your watch - are not standalone, apps, they're, basically apps on your iPhone with a watch counterpart. So you have to start to see these apps in the App Store that say they have an Apple watch. App and that's how you'll know you're getting into one and you'll have to activate it on your iPhone to get it to appear on the watch and if it has a glances card, you can activate that too, and basically, all of your organization is done from the Apple watch app on the iPhone so organization of that weird bubbly cluster of icons on the watch is done from your phone and the changes are updated. Pretty much immediately, not sure if this is the best looking interface for launching apps but hey, it works now. Actually, using the Apple watch, apps is okay. The experience you get really depends on the functionality built into the watch app, but for the most part they work kind of well they're, just slow. If you're going to open up an app on your watch to do something. You'Re probably doing it because it's faster than pulling out your phone, but in a lot of cases Apple watch apps are so slow that you might as well just take out your phone and do the same action at the same speed on a bigger screen. There are some good Apple watch apps, a lot of the built-in ones are actually the best and they also tend to make more use of the digital crown. But for the most part I would describe the app experience as smooth, but not fast. You really have to want to use the watch to use those apps, but it's really best at is notifications, so the Apple watch is really good at just quietly. Tapping me on the wrist and alerting me of a new notification on my iPhone without me. Having to take my phone out of my pocket, that's really nice! I end up using my phone less. I save a little bit of battery and a little bit of time by dismissing stuff. I don't want to respond to without ever touching my phone and that's what smartwatches should be good at the haptic engine in the watch. The vibration motor is actually really good too. It'S much cleaner and better feeling. It'S almost like a tap on the wrists, much better feeling than any other SmartWatch I've used, and it uses that subtle tap vibration for not only notifications but reminders and stuff. So like the activity tracker, which reminds me to stand up every once in a while to reach the fitness goals, that was cool unless it was telling me to stand up in class and also it's used for force touch. So the Apple watch's display is pressure-sensitive and, as the name implies, you can touch with a little extra force to open some more options like clearing all notifications or changing watch faces and speaking of watch faces. Here'S a real bummer, no third party watch faces at all. No downloading any other cool watch faces from the app store and that sucks I mean that's like half the fun of the Android wear smartwatches out there, but hey there's your classic Apple lockdown mentality. Maybe Apple watch version 2 will get third party watch faces. But for now, if you like one of the default ones - and you pick that or you just grab the one you dislike, the least my favorite is the modular one. It kind of sets up like a regular watch where you use a digital crown like a dial on the side, to get the information exactly where you want it, and then it constantly gives you that info. It'S pretty clean, not bad, but I would have loved to have way more watch face options in the app store seriously. So with all this, if you're like me, you're still having a hard time justifying the price of this iPhone accessory. So let me tell you some other things: it does really well. First of all, it has a great display. It'S an LCD display at 290 pixels per inch, so it's really bright and really sharp, and yet the blacks get surprisingly black. So, even though it's not an oled display, it's awesome both indoors and outdoors, and the watch itself is pretty comfortable, actually very comfortable. Even though it's kind of thick it's one of the most comfortable smartwatches, I've worn, which is like a decent amount. It'S also got average battery life, I'd say pretty good, it's almost always around a day and a half, so it's never lasted a full two days comfortably, but it's never dead after one day and it has the best gyroscope I've used in any SmartWatch. It'S hands-down the best at knowing when I'm looking at it and turning on and then knowing when I'm not looking at it and turning the screen off. So, even if you don't use all the features like taking phone calls with the speakerphone or messaging with the weird gloved emojis or sending heartbeats, even if you never use any of that, it's still pretty good at patience which is sort of the core of what it's Supposed to do, but in terms of whether or not you should buy one well, just like a battery case for your iPhone or a camera lens, it's an accessory for your iPhone and it should be treated as exactly that. At the end of the day, the base price - it doesn't really stick out from any other smartwatches in any crazy way. We might just have to wait till version 2 for that, thanks for watching now talk to you guys in the next one peace """
Ws9KAQS02Yo,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Review!,5:29,"Hey, what is up guys, i'm kbhd here and samsung, came out with two different versions of its flagship, android phone this year, the galaxy s6 and then the galaxy s6 edge, which you probably heard a lot about the regular galaxy s6. I reviewed as its own standalone phone it's great and a lot of ways. It'S one of the best phones you can buy, but then the edge is, as the name implies a little bit physically different. It has a curve over the edge of both sides of the glass and that costs a hundred dollars more for this version, so you better get something out of it. So what exactly do you get for your hundred bucks internally? These phones are identical, so they're the same phone same chip, same ram same camera, same everything objectively, the only real difference between them is the display and the dimensions. So the galaxy s6 edge is a tiny bit thicker than the regular s6. It'S seven millimeters thick and actually houses a slightly larger battery, a 2600 milliamp hour battery, so not a huge difference, but you know worth noting the biggest difference, though, from the build comes with the feel in the hand. So since the glass wraps around the sides of the phone and sort of extends the display a bit in an immersive way, it also means you get less of a side of the phone to hold on to when you're using it. And this is something you find out more and more as you're using the phone, but i found if i grip the phone the wrong way or squeeze it at all. I would actually start clicking things on the screen by accident, but if i was too careful to not touch the screen at all, then you're, basically just holding on to a sharp metal edge and that actually got uncomfortable after a while there's significantly less material to hold. On the sides, and because of the angles and the way it's built, you're really not holding onto a metal side you're holding onto a metal rail to pick up and hold the phone, it does make the phone look and feel super thin, and it is eye-catching. Believe me, but this turned into a case of feeling, like a little bit too thin now samsung does build in some neat. Software features to take advantage of the new shape, so it's not as extreme as the curve on the note 4 edge, which is only on one side, but this is a little bit more convenient here, since you can choose which side. Any of these features show up on so you get edge lighting for incoming calls people edge for a quick swipe in to contact your favorite people, information stream, to show notifications and info on the edge and the night clock. I found the night clock and information stream to actually make the most sense, since i take advantage of the oled display and only light the edge pixels when you have them in use, so they don't waste any battery, but they're. Actually, the features that i use the least because i just never felt compelled to use them, even though i feel like they'd be very easy to use, but the ones i did use are the people edge and the edge lighting they're very cool. So i have a few favorite contacts available and you can swipe in from well only the home screen. You can pull in that tab from the home screen at any time to contact them, and you can see they have a little ring around their picture with a color, and you got to remember these colors from again contact these people anytime. They contact me they're associated with that color. So if i miss a call from one of them, i get a sort of a side notification in addition to the one up top that gives me info on that missed call from one of my favorite contacts, and it lets me ping them back. If i want to right from there it's nothing, you couldn't do with a regular screen, but having the curve there makes this feel more natural and any incoming call from a favorite contact. While your phone is face down on the table, will light up the edges with that phone's uh that contact color, so you know who it is before you pick it up. The funny thing is, i didn't want to put this all glass phone face down on a table that often, but it was a nice thing to see it work uh, but that's about it for the edge specific features. Everything else about that edge display is just aesthetics. Just the crazy way it looks, people really like this apps suddenly feel a lot more immersive when it feels like there's no bezel at all content and images, just sort of spill over the sides of the phone with no barrier and the fact that it's curved makes A lot of the swiping more pleasant, too, you know all the the new apps with the new drawer that swipe in from the side, especially all the good google apps. They will be more comfortable to use because of this curve. This is probably a great phone for tinder with all that swiping so yeah, it's just not an aesthetically unique thing, but it actually has a little bit of benefit over the everyday use. The one thing to watch out for is glare and distortion again, since it's a curve, if it weren't curved. We would just be saying this is a phone with zero side bezel, but the curve introduces a little bit of glare problems that the regular galaxy s6 doesn't have to worry about. I mean there's almost no position that you can hold the edge and not get any glare from somewhere and there's also a little bit of light fall off on the far edges with the curve and then yeah distortion can be a factor with full screen. Media too you'll notice that so long story short when i was introduced to both the phones, the galaxy s6 edge and the regular galaxy s6. I really like the edge version a lot more, but this is one of those cases where the initial impression is a little bit different from the final verdict. I originally said the galaxy s6 edge could be its own standalone phone and the regular galaxy s6 is a sort of a backup in case this doesn't work, but now because it's 100 extra, it's sort of a different case and as cool as it is the edge Screen probably isn't worth the extra hundred dollars to most people. It does look really cool on a table and in the hand - and it does seem a lot thinner and a lot different and it does differentiate itself from a normal phone. But when you consider the price difference, it's a little harder to justify, maybe we'll see edge versions of samsung phones that aren't a full hundred dollars more than their regular counterparts in the future, but until then i'd say hold off, even though it looks pretty awesome. Thanks for watching and i'll talk to you guys in the next one, peace """
WjUebpBA2AE,Chromebook Pixel 2 Review!,5:02,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here and the target demographic for the Chromebook pixel to people who are expected to buy it as a percentage of the normal population is almost nothing but that's okay. This is a Chromebook pixel, 2ls and apparently LS stands for ludicrous speed and I believe it. It has the specs that look way too ridiculous to belong in any Chromebook, and I wasn't originally going to do a video about it, but after actually using it for a while. I have to at least show it to you guys, because I like it too much. Not to basically I'm guilty of falling in love with an incredible piece of hardware, even if it does have a pretty narrow functionality. So, on the outside, it's pretty simple: it's an all-metal design, nearly the same as last year and a bunch of little tweaks are made to make this version better than that. So it's weighted pretty much perfectly as a laptop, so you can lift the hinge without the bottom of the laptop moving. So that's a nice touch and it has a slightly new keyboard design. So all the special keys up top that it functions inside Google Chrome are now a little bit lower. So they feel like part of the rest of the keyboard, and this is actually a really nice keyboard. It has a decent amount of travel and it's a pleasure to type on for long periods of time, because that's exactly what I did and the trackpad is also new. It has built-in gestures now kind of like OS 10, so you can use a four finger swipe to reveal all of your open chrome windows, which kind of feels like real multitasking. When you have a bunch of apps open and of course, you can't forget where it got its name, the Chromebook pixel has an incredible display again very bright, very vivid, very contrast, the awesome viewing angles and 2560 by 1700's, so some extra vertical pixels for web browsing And web apps since everything Scrolls vertically anyway, and it's still an awesome touchscreen too, and because of these awesome specs, it's actually really smooth, like very impressive, kinetic scrolling felt iPad like on this massive display. I mean I was very impressed using it and then, of course there is new ports, so the Chromebook pixel switched out its old charger for a USB C port and not one but two so one on either side. So, on one side you have a USBC port and a full-size SD card reader, so there's your expandable storage and, on the other side, another USB C port. So, yes, you can plug in to either side and as a backup. You also get two full-size USB ports and the headphone jack, so I mean with this combination of specs and build and ports and price and everything honestly, this would make an awesome Windows, machine or Mac laptop before you even find out. It runs, Chrome OS. So that's also neat, there's also a pretty dope LED light strip up top, and that has some new features too now, so it lights up all colors, when your laptop is on, which i think is pretty nice. It was yellow only in last year's and then there's this knock feature which is probably heard about. When the laptop is closed. You can just knock three times and it'll light up with the amount of battery life you have left, which is really cool and when you plug in it tells you how close you are to done charging. That'S a nice way around the USBC charger, not having an indicator light. The absolute worst part of the Chromebook pixel hardware is a toss-up between either the speakers this time or the camera. The camera is just this. Garbage 720p webcam wasn't expecting to be impressed with it, but hey at least I can say it's not 480p em and the speakers are actually underneath the keyboard. So there are no speaker, girls or anything. It just kind of sounds like the sound is being muffled by the keyboard because it is but outside of those two things you know, performance is extremely good all the time battery life is extremely good. You can get 10 plus hours of use every single day and the apps you get from the Chrome Web Store. Look, it doesn't do much, but what it does do it does very well. The Chrome Web Store is a lot more full-featured now than it was last year when I showed it, and you can now sort by apps that are just links to websites versus actually fully built web apps, which are much better, and you can also run apps that Were built for Android on this thing too, so you can legitimately get a lot done in this newest version of Chrome OS. Now, if you've gotten this far and you're still thinking dude, why would I want to pay over $ 1000 for a web browser? I could get way more for less money, then this is definitely not for you, but for those who can get away with using mostly web apps, which have gotten really good and maybe having a cheap Windows machine on the side. For when you need something, that's not available online, this is a beast of a machine. The one thing I'd like to change since Wi-Fi and internet isn't available everywhere. I would like to see this laptop with LTE, so I could have Internet on-the-go. That would be pretty damn close to my perfect ultra portable, so that is the story there for the Chromebook pixel. It is like the original, a beautiful piece of engineering and an incredible piece of hardware that you should probably never buy. Well, I mean you can buy it, but you should know what you're getting yourself into first. They have it thanks for watching if you enjoyed it, feel free to hit that thumbs up button below and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace """
Mhvv2-iCKao,Samsung Galaxy S6 Review!,13:05,"Hey what is up guys, MTV, HD here and the Galaxy S - has been Samsung's flagship smartphone for the past few years, and each version improves a bit on the previous version. Of course. So this year we get this the Samsung Galaxy s6, and not only is it, of course, the best Galaxy S. Yet it's actually one of the best smartphones out there period in several ways, so of course, being a flagship high-end smartphone, it's on top of the spec game. It'S rocking the latest internals, so the Exynos 7420 and octa-core 64-bit processor, a Mallee, GPU, 3 gigabytes of RAM and up to 128 gigs of non-expandable storage. A lot of people wish it was expandable, but this is the first Galaxy S that doesn't have a microSD card slot and doesn't have a removable battery, and this is because the brand new design, so the new build, is the biggest change from the galaxy s5 and Honestly, from a lot of other flagships, it actually reminds me a lot of the Nexus 4 again where it's glass on the front and on the back and chamfered metal sides, and this phone is thin, really thin. Just six point: eight millimeters, so it really does need a place to hold it. So the metal is what you're going to be gripping most of the time and metal feels great in the hand. We'Ve learned that from other flagships like the one m9 and the Moto X, so the galaxy s6 is no exception and the glass on the front and back sort of curves down right around the edges of the phone. So it's not as sharp as something like the note 4 was and it won't catch on to hairs or anything. So it's really easy to drag your fingers across the edges and overall, it's just a really solid feeling. Phone in the hand, button placement is also on point is very clicky and tactile. You got the power button on the right and the volume buttons on the left, and you have your headphone jack and a pretty decently loud speaker on the bottom, better than rear facing, but obviously not as good as front facing speakers. And yes, the bottom of the galaxy s6 looks just like the bottom of the iPhone 6, quick, which one is which exactly but whatever it's still a great spot for everything and Samsung nailed it with the chamfered metal. But it's not perfect, though. Thanks to its glass front and back and the relatively curved sides, galaxy s6 probably falls into top-5 slipperiest phones of all time. I'Ve actually had it literally slide out of my pocket, while I'm sitting down and almost slide off of a table when I was resting on a slightly built-in binder and of course, since it's a glossy glass like that from the Nexus for the back of this phone, Is a fingerprint magnet in literally every color, probably the fastest, I've ever wanted to skin. On the back of my phone anyway, around the front. At first glance, it looks pretty much like any previous Samsung device. The shape is the same, and the layout, as you can see, is the same as well, but there are a few improvements here. Number one is the home button. It'S a much improved home button on the galaxy s5 because, first of all, it's much clicky ER and more tactile and more satisfying to press and number two. The fingerprint reader in it is much better. It'S no longer requiring a full swipe of your finger to read it, but just a touch like the touch ID on the iPhone. So you touch to unlock and for this reason it's much faster at unlocking your phone and so for those of you who like to use fingerprint for security. This is going to make you very happy. I still turned it off after a bit because for me it never quite got my finger right on the first. Try kept telling me to try again to get my whole finger over the button. Maybe a different finger would have worked better or even recalibrating it, but either way it is a big improvement over the galaxy s5, and this new home button also serves as a double tap shortcut to quickly get into the camera which I'll talk about later, and it Sits between the capacitive multitasking and back buttons, the one thing about the capacitive buttons that I objectively think is sort of bad. Is you can't control how long they stay lit anymore? For some reason, that setting is gone so they're always beyond for like a full? Second, before they turn off and also you can't control the brightness of them. So if you're in a dark room - and you have your screen brightness, all the way down - you'll still get blinded by the surprisingly bright capacitive buttons at the bottom of the phone. So I kind of wish they have that setting back where I could at least have them not light up at all or turn off very quickly as of right now, the only way to make that happen is, with a third-party app come on Sammy, either way. The other impressive improvement up front is the display. This is the best screen on any smartphone hands-down. It'S big it's bright and it's beautiful. It'S a 5.1 inch display so not too huge, especially with thin enough bezels to make this phone narrower than the galaxy s5 and it's rocking a 2560 by 1440 resolution. So quad HD it is super crispy and it's also a Super AMOLED display in typical Samsung fashion. So colors are vivid and saturated and really impressive to pretty much any eye and it gets crazy bright too, so it's very visible outdoor, which is not something every smartphone can say and that's very impressive for an OLED display. There are a couple of settings to tone down the contrast to saturation if you're not feeling it, but overall, this is where Samsung does their best work, and it's no surprise that this screen is so ridiculous. Almost looks like paper here at 577, pixels per inch, really impressive, stuff and, of course pushing all the pixels around is no joke, but the hardware is only half the story. You also got to consider the software on top of Android here TouchWiz now, when Samsung first introduced me and a couple of other people to this phone, they mentioned that they're going to minimize the bloatware and essentially promised that this would be the lightest version of TouchWiz. Yet, and if you remember previous Samsung phones and previous reviews of Samsung phones, we've talked about the fact that TouchWiz is a heavy slow. Skinned performance has been a problem with it in the past and it's just slowed down the experience of using Android. That is no longer the case with touch waves. Finally, here now it still is this big bright, blocky, colourful thing, the aesthetics, unfortunately, I think, are not improved as much as the performances, but this is a really fast phone. Now, just everything about moving around this phone. Now is buttery smooth and is held up to day-to-day use. Great for me with pretty much zero lag, which is impressive. Opening and closing apps was fast and actually the multitasking menu is the fastest I've ever used in any phone and the phone handles multitasking like a champ, even adding that dual window feature from the galaxy note line. Of course, three gigabytes of RAM also helps a lot, although I do kind of find it hard to tell the difference between phones with two gigs and three gigs of RAM, but either way this thing is snappy now TouchWiz overall is still a design change too. So the skin kind of still has a face. Only a mother could love, but at least it's a bit less offensive than previous versions. That keyboard, for example, I really like it's probably my favorite and easiest to use of any Android skin and other updates - have really made this version of TouchWiz the cleanest. Yet so you can change. For example, the size of your homescreen grid to have one of three different sizes. Depending on how dense you want your icons to be, you can go in and out and use whatever theme. You want. There'S a theme engine, so you can have the ability to totally change the looks of everything in TouchWiz from the notifications to the quick settings and everything in just a few clicks and even the gallery, which used to be the most painfully slow app on any Samsung Phone is now caught up it launches at a normal rate. So of course it's not all greatness for one. I don't really know why s voice is still a thing. It keeps prompting me to use it, and I just don't want to use it. We have Google everywhere and stuff like the briefing page to the far left of your home screens, it's a little better than last year, but it's still kind of slow. It still lags when trying to swipe out of it. Now, it's obviously still touch with so there's no way around this skinned nature of Android 5.0 here, but you win some you lose some I've become willing to let a lot of the minor stuff go, though, because this phone has been so consistently fast. Like I said in the user experience that it's pretty dope beyond the way you know some of the icons might look, I can grab a custom launcher. I can grab a custom keyboard, a custom, icon pack, a theme. I can really make this my own and it'll still be crazy. Fast, I mean the camera opens in literally under a second for crying out loud. You can just double tap the camera button and it's basically already open. Actually I had this happen in my pocket. A few times and as a result, I've got plenty of pictures of the inside of my pocket, but you know what let's talk about the camera? Let'S talk about those pictures. The galaxy s6 is rocking a 16 megapixel sensor with a maximum F 1.9 aperture, with optical image, stabilization and 4k video and LED flash damn okay, so it looks great on paper. How does it actually perform? Well, I kind of ranted about this on Twitter. For a second but the galaxy s6 is packing the best camera in any Android smartphone period, and it's good enough for me to say it's tied for the best overall camera experience of any smartphone alongside the iPhone 6 plus. I even give it the edge because it can shoot stabilized 4k video as far as just pointing and shooting this camera is very fast and taking a photo is quick and the layout is much simpler than past years, which is actually nice. It'S pretty clean now so for the most part I left it in auto mode and it handled itself. Well, I was able to point and shoot at basically anything and get crispy pictures. But once in a while, I went into what's called the pro mode, which gives you a bunch more manual controls which will be more familiar to people who are into photography who have used a DSLR. I could change to manual focus manual exposure, pretty much manual. Everything except for shutter speed and I basically stay between those two modes to take all my photos on the galaxy s6 and the photos, as you can see, look pretty great. I thought it was weird that Samsung went with a sixteen by nine image at 16 megapixels, but okay on the images, the photos you see are crispy as hell beautifully detailed stuff here, even one the camera biases towards opening the lens wide open at F 1.9. You can get a nice creamy background depth of field. The colors are, of course, your typical Samsung, saturated and vivid, and the dynamic range is actually not bad here either a couple of times, you'll notice it biased towards overexposing just a little. So it does like to expose a bit hot, and that becomes more obvious when you take low-light shots, which is really the only place. I could get the images from this camera to look bad. It tries to brighten things up a little bit too much and then the image processing can't quite save it, but otherwise it's pretty much in any conditions. Great I've just walk up to a subject: double tap the home button, open the camera and then snap a quick photo and leave, and that's what makes this camera so great. It'S pretty much all the photos, I'm showing are just the first try and four seconds flat. I would take the image and be done now. Of course, you can sit around and tweak with other camera settings and stand there for a minute. While you try to get it just right and then claim yeah, it's totally capable of making the same picture, but for a normal person. This is exactly what you want in a smartphone camera just point and click and make beautiful images super easy. The most inconsistent part of the galaxy s6 experience for me has been the battery life, so it is a slightly smaller and now non removable battery, so there's no switching out the batteries and that's just to get the phone a little bit thinner. I'Ve talked about how I want thicker batteries and bigger phones in the past, but that's okay. This is what we have now and I was coming off of reviewing the HTC One m9, which, as I mentioned in that review, had a pretty good battery life and, with the exception of one day, I never killed the phone after a regular day of medium to Heavy usage with this phone, I had a much bigger spread, so I had some days where I was ending the day, with 30 % battery left, which was great and other days where I'd be dead by 4:00 p.m. or it would die in my pocket. I wouldn't know because I didn't get any notifications for a while until I checked and realized it was dead. This one has a really big spread and, at the end of the day, didn't really have all that great battery life. Now I did mention this in another phone review with a similar problem, the Nexus 6, and that made up for for me by having wireless charging and fast charging and the galaxy s6 does the same thing. So you can use qi wireless charging to put this phone on any wireless charger and charge up and have random cheat charges all over your place or you can just use a fast charger. So if you get home or have a chance to pop it on a quick charge somewhere during the course of your day, you won't have to worry as it'll just blast. I think it will add 50 % of your battery in 15 minutes or something absurd like that, so that sort of makes up for it from me. But I would still much rather prefer to have a larger battery and a slightly thicker phone to not have to worry about charging at all my screen on time, buried somewhere between three to three-and-a-half hours and again this is different for everyone's usage. But for me I guess for comparison, something like the oneplus one, which was a fantastic battery. Life was getting for me between four and a half to five hours of screen on time and something like the one m9, even though it didn't give me a number. I would estimate gave me between three and a half and four hours. So if I rated this battery life, it would be something like a c-plus, but the fact that you can quick charge it or wireless charging anywhere will make up for that for some people. So, at the end of the day, Samsung has come up with a pretty damn impressive package in the galaxy s6 and there's also the galaxy s6 edge, which I'll have a video coming up about soon so thumbs up. If you're excited to see that, but so far a best camera in any Android smartphone best screen in any smartphone really impressive build. If you can get around the fact that this is still TouchWiz and it's much better than a last version, this is going to be an awesome phone and it's something I'm definitely going to be recommending to people switching from other phones or upgrading or even sidestepping from Something like a Windows Phone or an iPhone. This is an awesome phone, good job Samsung. Looking forward to the next, I guess the note 5 is what I'm really pumped about seeing this year. That'S been it.

5x6DELO6Sz4,HTC One M9 Review!,11:59,"Hey what is up guys? I'M kV HD here, and this is the HTC One m9. So last year we had the HTC One m8, and that was a really well built phone has some great fast software and a let down camera. And so this year we have the one m9, which is a really well boat phone as great fast software and a let down camera. So a little background here, I've been using this one m9, as my daily driver on and off since Mobile World Congress. So, a couple of weeks now and yet I still kind of have a little bit of trouble, telling a difference between it and the One m8, at least from the front, without looking at it for a little bit. That'S because most of the changes with the one m9 are on the inside and for HTC. You'Ve probably heard this a thousand times were people talking about this phone, it's a story of. If it ain't broke, don't fix it and there was not a lot wrong with the original one and eight so for the n9 there's. You know a couple of small adjustments, a couple of tweaks here and there and some small changes to make it better. So this HTC One m9 from the front and the back is pretty similar. Looking to the m8, it's an all metal phone again, but it's not unibody anymore, so there's actually several pieces of metal being held together and along the sides. You get that strip all the way around the phone, that's a different color. So on my gunmetal m9, that strip is rounded off and black, but on the silver m9, that strip is a new piece of metal. So it's a bit of a sharper edge and it's a gold accent and the metal is also now this brushed look and it's a little more glossy kind of making it a fingerprint magnet, but also making it look a little more like jewelry in a way. So you got a bit of a toss-up if you like that or not it's definitely still a slippery phone, though so be warned. I haven't installed a skin on mine yet, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to end up doing that, just to make sure I never drop it. Htc also moved of the power button from the top right hand, side to the right hand, side of the phone, which is supposed to be in a more natural, easier to reach spot for your thumb. But unfortunately that's where the volume buttons already are. So they put the power button underneath those, and I think that was a bad move. The power button is now too low and to this day I still haven't gotten used to it and it even if it's ridged and clicky and separated from the rest. I constantly accidentally press the volume down button, like all the time that they should have done, is move the volume buttons over to the left and had that power button in a normal spot. But the good thing goes: you still have double tap to wake on the screen and you can even put a sleep-wake toggle in a software buttons. If you want but yeah overall build quality and button placement was not broken, so they had no need to overhaul it. To fix it, another thing that wasn't broken was the display and the One m8 had one of the best 1080p displays on any smartphone last year and we're seeing more quad HD displays this year from basically every manufacturer, but HTC is sticking with their trusty 1080p, and This LCD, as much as I like pixels, is still great. It'S very bright, has great colors, great viewing angles and everything, and since it's still a 5-inch display, the pixel density is still excellent. So you won't be seeing any of the pixels from a normal viewing distance and that awesome display, combined with the best speakers in any smartphone, make for an awesome media experience, whether you're gaming or watching YouTube videos or whatever you're doing boom sound, is king and second Place isn't even close now. Htc did add this Dolby audio to the m9, which is essentially just a software toggle between two eq's music mode and theater mode music mode is best for most stuff. I tend to leave it at that. It'S not distorted at all and it gets super loud and crispy, and I love that a theater mode is interesting because it simulates a bit of a surround sound effect. So it can be cool for videos or, if you're, watching a movie, but it definitely distorts it. A lot more so the build quality not broken the display not broken. The speakers definitely not broken so onto the software and HTC has kept it nice and clean with sense. 7 on this phone, it's built on top of Android 5.0, not sure when it's going to get the 5.1 update, but I'll keep an eye out for that. But this is now cleaned up to be actually one of my favorite Android skins that exists out there. I still prefer stock Android, but I used to really not like HTC Sense. At all the same way I hated TouchWiz and now there are there still, you know a couple parts of it. I don't like the keyboard, for example, constantly infuriates me with this terrible autocorrect. I hate the keyboard and the quick settings are still pretty ugly to me. I don't know why I am is insist on skinning every little part of Android and the quick settings seems like the one I got away. These just get uglier all the time, but, aside from stuff like that, you know sense, seven is a really neat. Skin blinkfeed is tidied up and, of course, still plugs into your social feeds and gives you up-to-date info, and this is the first HTC one where I didn't immediately want to disable and remove blinkfeed. Although you totally can and also speaking of skins, there's a whole theme engine built into HTC Sense now, so if you really don't like the way it looks stock, there are a ton of skins to pick from and apply that effect. Basically, everything about the software and the UI from the launcher to the software buttons to the app drawer and even the quick settings. So all the colors and all the theme look will be changed and the wallpaper too, and you can grab one of these pre-existing themes or you can build your own theme from a wallpaper or an image, and that is a legit way to customize your phone. Exactly as you want it like a boss and also it's Android, so a lot of the other elements like the keyboard or like the launcher, you can change those too. If you don't like them, there were a lot of other neat tricks built into this version of sense. I liked you can change the multitasking app view to be either the cards, which is what we're used to in most other versions of Android over the past few years or grid-view, which is something that HTC sort of introduced with the one series that not everybody liked. But now you have the choice, which is a cool way of not exactly backtracking on that, but I do prefer the card view and you also have these screen off gestures. So we saw these in the last one. You cannot only double tap to wake the phone and double tap again to sleep, but there are also a bunch of other swipe Direction, functions that you can learn and decide to use and actually enable individually. If you want to use them. I found a lot of these were just going off in my pocket with the last HTC One, but I did keep the DoubleTap on because it didn't do that in my pocket. So that's pretty cool and these also work very well with the dot view case. So that's a pretty baller combo and another thing they introduced. Is this home screen widget? It'S supposed to be a pretty smart thing where it knows you, if you're at home, it knows when you're at work. It knows when you're out. All this is from your GPS location and, of course, with every phone. That'S tried to guess where I work it thinks my school is where I work, because I go there every day, but it worked. Okay, give me some decent productivity apps when I went to class and then when I came home and tried to get me to slack off and watch YouTube. You know the usual constantly had these suggested apps too, that weren't even installed on my phone, not sure what that's about but yeah. It just moved off to the second homescreen of mine and I just kind of left it there to do its thing and I explore once in a while. But if you hated it more than I did, you could easily remove it because it's just a widget, so yeah. The software experience here on the one m9 is great overall performance, to which I talk about less and less in these reviews, because they keep getting so good. Now is great three gigabytes of RAM Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. That power that thing it's basically a performance champ. You see me navigating through it. It'S responsive, animations are very short, so everything is snappy and quick, and I never really found an instance to get it to stutter or hold up. It did get warm. Some people were asking if my m9 ever overheated, it did get warmer than other phones. I played with recently for sure, especially when charging or using with the screen on for a very long period of time, but I never actually overheated like. I had with some other phones like the g3, where it had. You know limited functionality because of the heat, the metal body. This phone does get very warm to the touch when you're intensely gaming, but generally it's actually nothing to worry about, and the battery life has been decent, actually, the one m9. It gives you a really detailed breakdown of the battery usage in the software, but it doesn't actually give you a screen on time. So I felt like I was getting my usual three to three-and-a-half maybe four hours of screen on time, but I couldn't actually see a number at the end of the day. So I just go by the fact that I was ending the day with 15 to 20 percent battery left to tell that it was pretty good normal usage. I had one weird anomaly day where it died early, but overall battery life was pretty good. Now, undoubtedly, the biggest challenge HTC had when going from the One m8 to the m9 was the one part of the phone that people did consider broke. That'S the camera. The HTC One m8 s biggest flaw last year was its back facing four megapixel or ultra pixel camera. It was actually a bit of a downgrade from the m7 which had optical image stabilization, so that was the biggest change of philosophy. This time around, as the one m9 has a 20 megapixel camera, so ultra pixels are almost gone. The front-facing camera actually is still a pretty decent ultra pixel selfie camera, but now everyone is curious, just how good is the slightly protruding 20, a pixel camera on the back of the m9? Well, it's still not that good and that's unfortunate because we all like to take pictures on our phones and normally it's not a problem or anything, but this one is especially not good. So 20 megapixels yeah, that's nice, that's great and everything pictures are sharper. You have more detail than before, but the camera here is a classic case of more megapixels, doesn't always equal better pictures. The main problem here is dynamic range, so you know how you normally tap on the viewfinder to set the brightness of your photo. Whatever you tap it on, it changes the auto exposure, that's nice and quick and snappy on this phone, and it's taking a picture is just as snappy too, but it's almost never exposed correctly. To get everything I want. The dynamic range is terrible on this camera and, as a result, no matter how hard I try, there's always something way, overexposed and blown out or way underexposed and too in the dark like every photo. I take has this problem so naturally I turn on HDR to try to get some high dynamic range stuff, but the effect is kind of overly strong and doesn't look natural anymore, and all of that combined with almost embarrassing 4k video. That kind of looks like up scaled 720p. Ah, it's just a frustrating cameraman and I wanted to be good. So much now look there's been talks. There'S been talks about a software upgrade that could potentially make this better, and usually that can happen, but for this one I'm thinking it's the hardware, I'm putting the blame on the hardware. It really shouldn't be this bad and if you look it up most other high-end Android smartphones, even the iPhone use a Sony sensor. These things are tried-and-true and produce some spectacular images. For some weird reason, if Cece went with some random Toshiba built sensor - and that would be where I place the blame - it all kind of makes sense. The poor dynamic range, the washed out color, even the best image processing - probably can't save this one, and I say that with regret because, like I said, I wanted it to be a lot better. So, overall, as a package, this one m9 is still a really good phone and for people coming from the 1m 7, the first HTC One. This is going to be an awesome upgrade and for the one I made probably less, of a critical one, especially if you don't take a lot of photos. If you do take a lot of photos, long, it's more fawning are used to having a good camera in your pocket. This is sort of a hit or miss thing again. Some of the photos it takes can look pretty good, but there are better Android camera experiences out there and the iPhone takes better pictures and some windows phones take better pictures. So if you have cameras and photo and video taking high on your list of priorities when you're buying a smartphone 109s, probably not at the top your list. That being said, like I said at the beginning of this video, this is an extremely well-built phone with great fast software, and that's what it's doing really really well here, and it doesn't hurt that it has the best speakers on any phone period and also happens to Have a gorgeous 1080p display, so that's it for the one m9.

JDJDeuJbiKc,Logitech MX Master Review!,5:14,"Hey what is up guys and qHD here and the mkbhd mouse game has not always been strong, but as a student and someone who edits a lot of video, I spend a lot of time at the computer with a mouse. So my first real mouse wasn't all that special, just a pretty standard wired one, but my first real upgrade as with a lot of other people, I think, was to the Logitech and next series so really popular with the MX revolution and the performance MX. And these two were great, I loved mine, but actually after a few months, I got some connection issues, so I stopped using it and went back to a different wired mouse. But now Logitech is back with a successor. This ones aiming to fill the shoes of the predecessor and then some so, of course, I'm giving it a shot. This is the Logitech MX master, so right off the bat. This is a pretty good-looking Mouse and I kind of have a feeling that a sports car designer or something was involved with this design, I mean first of all, the commercials show a whole lot of sculpting and chiseling of a model mouse, and I don't know if That happens with every other Mouse, but I do know that's exactly what happens with a lot of sports cars and the MX master looks, I don't know kind of sporty in a way. It has a lot of the same looks as the previous MX Mouse, with the right E shape and the big sloping curves, but the same time I've never seen a mouse. That looks quite like this, with the little rivets on the thumb rest and the big arching spine. It'S actually a great size and shape for someone with big hands. Just like the performance MX was, but even if you don't have big hands, it puts your hand in a more ergonomic resting position for better long-term comfort. And just you know, people with bigger hands require a bigger arch in the mouse to make this happen, which is why the Magic Mouse is like the spawn of Satan but yeah. The MX master aside from a few design tweaks, is very similar to the performance MX that came before it. Here'S what's noticeably different. First, the back and forward buttons they're, pretty small and they're supposed to be in a pretty comfortable position, above the thumb rest, but they're. Just a little too far back for me, so I had to adjust my hand a bit when I wanted to use them which slowed me down still getting used to that. I would have liked to see them a little bit further up next to that side, scrolling wheel and speaking of the side scrolling wheel, it's back from the MX revolution of two generations ago, and it is awesome. I use it all the time it's nice and smooth. Now it's a bit smaller and I think it's easy to use. You don't really know how useful horizontal scrolling is until you don't have it anymore and I missed it big-time actually. Is it most well video, editing and moving through my timeline in Premiere Pro and After Effects and stuff like that, so horizontal scrolling is dope on the bottom of the mouse. You'Ll find the third new thing, which is the connectivity. So this is a Logitech mouse. So you can use the tiny Logitech wireless receiver we've all seen if your computer doesn't have bluetooth, but the mouse also has built-in Bluetooth 4.0. So you'll have that choice. My mac pro has bluetooth, so I just turned it on and it connected within like five seconds. No problem and you'll see it has three numbers on the back and a little button. That'S because this mouse has a memory and can live switch connecting between three different devices at the same time, which can be really useful. So I have number one connected to my desktop number. Two connects to my laptop and number three is actually not occupied yet so you can see it triggers the pairing mode and it's blinking waiting to add any third device. But it's super useful. So I can see myself using this a lot, especially if you have a setup where maybe you have two computers side-by-side and you don't want to have two mice on your desk or any other crazy software solution to make that happen. Now it's really useful. You can use one Mouse for multiple computers, so yeah other than that. It'S all in the software with this guy the new Logitech option. Software is the first thing you should download when you get this mouse and it's actually pretty good, so most Mouse software is not that pretty doesn't work that well, but I don't mind this at all now. This is where you set up the horizontal scrolling everything it also lets. You turn that thumb rest button. Yes, that's a button into a gesture pad, so you can hold it down and swipe into mac, OS x gestures, and you can also adjust the smart scrolling here. So a logitech is kind of famous for this, where, if you scroll the mouse wheel fast enough, it'll stop clicking and just initiate this super smooth, fast scrolling mode until it slows down enough to go back to clicking again, so you can toggle how fast it needs To do that or just disable, it completely there's also a nice little battery indicator in the software. Now the battery in this mouse - it's actually sealed in which is a change from the performance MX which had a removable battery. But i've had this thing for about a week and haven't had to charge it yet. So i'm thinking it's probably going to hold up to its claims of several weeks of battery life with normal use, plus you can still plug it into USB to charge it and continue using it. Although i'm kind of surprised it's not USB type-c, so overall Logitech is probably hoping this MX master becomes the next legendary Mouse that everyone eventually moves to the next standard and well, I'm already on board - and I know a bunch of other people who make tech videos Who are already on board too? So it's off to a pretty good start. I'D say it's worth the $ 99 price tag on Amazon right now, but I say definitely check back at that link in the description. If you don't want to buy it now check back in a couple of months, it'll probably start to drop like the performance. Mx did so my mouse game is strong again and hey. Maybe the keyboard game is next thanks for watching guys and onto some more important long awaited reviews. Talk to you guys. The next one face. """
3yoAj-PRsZ0,Audio Technica ATH-M70X Review!,6:14,"Hey what is up guys, I'm cabbie HD here - and these are the audio technica ath m70x. Yes, there's been a lot of curiosity about these brand new headphones coming out, especially since the ath M 50s have been so damn popular, and these seem to have an upgraded name and a bigger price tag with an MSRP up over 400 bucks. Although you can get them on Amazon for 300 bucks linked below so with the m70x, the number one question I get, and actually the easiest way to talk about them is how do they compare to the M 50s? The M 50s. Get all this praise all the time for being some of the most incredible sounding headphones for a very low price, so now that the M 70s come along for a much higher price, naturally we're all curious about if they're, that much better so with headphones. My comparisons can be very simple: I don't have to worry about battery life or display tech or anything crazy like that, it's just how they're built and how they sound so with the build quality. The m70x are very simple and pretty similar to the M 50s. I'Ll be honest, I was looking for a bunch, more metal or other premium materials, because I honestly expected that with such a price increase but nope, it's all steel hardened plastic again this time with a matte coat instead of glossy plastic. So it's a soft touch and they have a pretty traditional styling, a pretty sharp tuxedo look here in black. I think they'd be much more interesting if they offered it in some other colors like the M 50s, but that might come later so they ditched the big. Bold Technica branding on the top of the M 50s for a much simpler, subdued look on the M 70s, but this band here is still very flexible. It will suit all sorts of head sizes, although now it is actually only padded in the middle where it actually touches your head and overall, the headphones are just actually a lot lighter. This makes them more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. Actually, no, that was a pretty big complaint about the M 50s that there were a little bit too tight. The M 70s still have a fantastic seal with even softer ear cups and all around them, but they sit a little bit lighter on your head. Now, the only one notable difference here with the EM 70s is that they don't fold anymore. So if you remember them 50s, those could fold up right on and just fit in like a little travel bag with about half the footprint of being fully expanded, and the EM 70s are lacking. That hinge that it needs to do that, so you can still swivel the ear-cups 90 degrees to lie flat. But that means you need a larger case here that actually comes with it to store them and travel, and I guess that's a pro and a con. It'S a con because they are a bit bigger and it requires more space. They don't fit into quite a small of a bag, but it is a really nice case that it comes with it's a high-quality hardshell with padding on the inside, and this soft matte finish on the outside. That'S pretty pleasant to hold, so it's free and it comes with in everything. So that's great! Now you also get an additional cable bag on the inside too. I didn't use it that much since I really only use the one coiled cable, but the m70 s do come with three cables, so it has a two metre, long short straight cable, a three meter, long long straight cable and a three meter, long coiled cable. So I use the coil and most often like I said, and they all connect to the headphones via that same new twist and lock mechanism that we saw on the m50x. So again it does mean you can't really use any third party cables. If you wanted something colorful or something braided or something like that, but the twist and lock is a pretty secure fit and a high quality way to connect your cable. So, overall yeah these things are built pretty well, but there's obviously nothing spectacular about them, which I guess it isn't really meant to be. You'Ll see why in a second, but of course the most interesting part is how they sound. So I did a lot of listening. I don't know if I believe in the whole burning in headphones or anything, but I've had these for about a week now, and I've been doing plenty of listening mostly to music lots of it on Spotify on my phone, but then also plugged into the deck on Mike and Peter, and how to listen to some higher quality audio files there, including actually mixing the last video I did, which was the Dell tablet review and the bottom line about the sound, is this: these are studio monitors like for real, so that means they have A very neutral, sound signature, which is what you want if you're monitoring or mixing audio to the untrained here, that may sound like it's lacking base or even might be a little bit tinny. But you got to understand that this flat frequency response is exactly what you want when editing. So the m50 s will sound very rich because they do have more bass in the m70 as they'll sound way more colored, and they will continue to sound better for everyday. Listening and music and movies and gaming and all sorts of stuff like that, but for monitoring and mixing and producing the even more flat, sound and lightweight comfort of the EM 70s is really what you want now. If we back up for a second, the M in m70x stands for monitors right, so closed back headphones, but audio technica, actually newly introduced. Something called the ath r70 x and r is for open back reference headphones and a lot of times when you step up in price for audio quality like this you're gon na want to move to open back headphones. It'S kind of like moving two speakers in your room that are right next to your ears. It'S something that I can explain in a later video, but for now I think the m70x is really the upper limit when it comes to closed back production headphones that you want to get in this price if you've bought the M 50s or the m50x already. No need to worry, I'm gon na continue using and recommending them in their ridiculously awesome price bracket for their rich, clear, sound. I use them all the time for traveling and listening, but for production headphones. I say for the price. The M 70s are starting to compete with some open-back headphones, but if you absolutely must have closed back, monitors can't go wrong with these, so there you go. That'S the audio technica ath m70x and a recap of the m50x. Thank you for watching and i'll talk to you guys in the next one bass. """
KG9E5LaI8bk,Dell Venue 8 7000 Review!,6:49,"Hey what is up guys and cabbie HD here and normally, when you think of Android tablets, you don't think of Dell. I needed it uh, but they're starting out 2015 on a pretty hot note, with their first entry into the high-priced mid-sized Android tablet category with this. This is the Dell Venue 8 7000, so obviously the design is the number one thing that's gon na stand out here. First of all, it's the world's thinnest tablet actually didn't know that when I got it, it's six millimeters thin, although not exactly sure, that's a good thing being so thin. It has square edges and being thicker, wouldn't make it any more difficult to hold or anything, and it's actually kind of hard to pick up off a flat table. So I wouldn't mind it being a little bit thicker or a little bit more rounded, to house some extra battery, but there you have it. It'S super thin and when you take a step back, is probably going to remind you of the sharp aquos crystal that I reviewed not too long ago, but blown up into a tablet size. So it has the three thin bezels around the top and sides and one big chin with a front facing speaker and front facing camera on the bottom, and this is a pretty polarizing design. I think it's actually really cool for a phone, but it's a bit different on a tablet. Phones, these days are mainly for use with one hand in portrait mode, but tablets like this are more often used with two hands, so it gets switched to landscape a lot. This Dell tablet really seems like it's meant to stay portrait and stay in one hand, because when you turn it sideways things get weird. You know as the speaker's supposed to be on the left side or on the right side. There'S no palm rejection. Technology like iPad set, so you got to be careful about how you hold it on the thinner side, I don't know it seems like the design is better suited towards phones, but you can make it work now, this speaker on the chin here, it's a stereo speaker. Actually - and it gets pretty loud, which is difficult to muffle by accident, but there's no stereo audio image, since everything is coming from one side, which is a shame, because it's actually a really good speaker. But you do have, of course, this good chunk of metal over here on the side to grip to hold it, and I got ta say it's overall, a very well-built tablet got handed to Dell with the metal chassis and the tactile very clicky buttons. I liked I'm sure you could bend it if you tried hard enough, but at least you don't sit on your tablet. So the one thing that actually did annoy me, the build materials was this glass on the back. It does house the rear facing cameras. I'Ll talk about in a bit, but it's a serious fingerprint magnet, which is not pretty and also the first one of these tablets that I had shipped to me from Best Buy. The packaging was a little bit bumped in just a little bit on the corner, but because the tablets, it's so close to the edge of the packaging, this little bruise turned out to be a big crack on the corner of the tablet, the weakest spot. Obviously, this isn't going to happen to everyone, but I have to mention it, but my new one obviously has no problems, so these midsize tablets are getting more and more beautiful and powerful, and this is in addition to both of those trends. So it's rocking an 8.4 inch 2560 by 1600 OLED display and it is beautiful. You can see with these dull live wallpapers and all kinds of stuff. It is seriously. One of the best-looking tablet displays I've ever seen, it's sixteen by nine, so it handles videos. Well, movies, look fantastic and that's really what these tablets are all about: right, media consumption and also gaming. Gaming looks really good again. If you can get past the weird grip ergonomics and the one sided speaker. This is about as good as games can look on an Android tablet, super bright, colorful, vivid, saturated, great viewing angles and everything it's really nice and with all these pixels gaming performance is also very impressive, but now I'm just you know, playing regular, not super intense games, Like Leo's fortune and Riptide gp2 and Real Racing 3, but it handles them all really well, and I guess you could say, portrait games are its specialty with audio coming out from the front facing speaker. Feels kind of like this thing was built for breaking Temple, Run records anyway pass gaming. All these pixels tend to make near stock Android elements, look pretty small, but also very sharp and in everyday performance. With this 2k display, I did see, dropped frames not really like lag or slowness, but definitely dropping frames which made animations look like they stutter, even though they go the correct speed. It'S roxeanne, android, 4.4 kitkat, hopefully lollipop very soon to improve performance a bit and it's fairly lightly customized. So nothing too crazy, like a heavy skin. But some stuff is added for the Dell and Intel experience, but it stays pretty close to stock Android in the look and feel so. It'S rocking an Intel, Atom, quad-core processor, at 2.3, gigahertz and two gigs of ram and has little additions like max audio, which stays permanently in your notifications. But it's really just a shortcut to a super, simple equalizer and stuff, like my dell in quick settings and other things to flip, to silence and intel smart video. They all kind of sit buried in the settings. Little things that I use maybe once or twice to demo them, but then never really found myself using again, so I just really use it like any any other Android tablet really and the rest of the experience is pretty familiar. So it's great for that stock. Android kitkat is compelling to use here in portrait mode, which is fine, it's just weird, because it feels like a giant phone experience instead of a small tablet experience. The tablet has three camera sensors on the back that are pretty much impossible to take a picture with, without blocking them somehow but they're supposed to combine to take 8 megapixel photos and also record depth information using intel's realsense technology. It might remind you of what the HTC One m8 did with its duo. Camera. Sorry Dale. I didn't really use it Alabama much it's a tablet and I don't really use my tablet to take pictures for any sort of exotic reasons other than to just have one to scan, barcodes or something so it's there. I only really used it once because it required the Dell gallery app to actually take advantage of any of these features. It looked like it worked. Ok, but yeah, it didn't really use it. So, at the end of the day, this is one of the more head-turning interesting looking Android tablets out there and it's a risk. It'S not necessarily my favorite design. I still think there are better ways to do a mid-size tablet, but I'm glad Dell took the risk and taking risks is good. That being said, I don't think I would recommend this as my first choice for a tablet in this midsize category. There are still over things like the Nexus 9, the iPad Mini retina and even the Nvidia shield tablet that I think, are all better buys for this approximate size and price. I would probably recommend this more if it was 100 bucks less but still good on Dell. For taking the risk and it's their first dip at getting their feet wet in the premium, Android tablet category, I would still give the edge to this in the display department over pretty much any other mid-size tablet. But it depends on how much you weigh that against the other things. So there you go.

26C_O6hDMjQ,Motorola Droid Turbo Review!,6:32,"Hey what is up guys, I'm cubie HD here and welcome to my better late than never review of the Droid turbo by Motorola. So in case you haven't noticed, motorola has been kind of killing it this year in 2014 they had one of the most liked. Wearables of the whole year, they had one of the best, somewhat small phones of the whole year that one of the best budget phones of the whole year and they had one of the best big phones of the whole year and their latest release. Here in the Droid turbo or the Moto Maxx on some other carriers is actually, I think, one of their best experiences yet so, essentially, the turbo offers the same software experience as the Moto X, and I talked a lot about this in the Moto X review about How Motorola is sticking to near stock Android to give quick updates and are just adding a few features on top to enhance the experience? So the turbo does this too, and it's on KitKat right now, but fingers crossed that will be updated to lollipop very soon and the other software difference really is that it has some droid specific widgets, some ringtones of wallpapers, but that's basically it so to best describe This phone, I'm going to give you all the ways that it's different from the 2014 Moto X and the first way it's different is the build quality and materials so right off the bat. What you're looking at here is the black material called ballistic nylon and there's actually two choices and materials. Ballistic nylon or Kevlar Kevlar comes in red and only has a 32 gigabyte version looks a lot smoother but honestly also a little bit slippery err, even though I haven't held one to determine, if that's true, but the ballistic nylon here is much more textured. In fact, it's more texture than any other phone I've held in recent years is a super 3d woven pattern, kind of like carbon fiber, but much thicker. It'S actually so thick that sometimes it catches, lint and dust or whatever is in your pocket around stuff near the camera and the Motorola logo, which I hate, but I still prefer having that a little bit of texture over something totally smooth on a phone. That'S curved like this also bonus. There is no Verizon [ __ ] stamp anywhere on this phone props to that so overall, the turbo is really well built like previous droids, and it feels really durable, really solid to hold in the hand, and it has some slight curving, like I said near the Edges that make it feel less like a brick and also the edge of the glass are curved a bit as well, so the corners aren't sharp and the power and volume buttons are both texture. Also fun. Fact the sim card tray sits behind the volume keys, so you actually have to remove the volume buttons to change your SIM card. But overall this thing is built like a tank and speaking of curved glass. That brings us to number two and that's the display on the front. The Droid turbo is rocking a 5.2 inch, quad HD display so 2560 by 1440 resolution at 565, pixels per inch and it's an OLED display and it's razor sharp. So basically, what I'm saying here is it rivals the note 4 for one of the best screens on any phone and we're not just saying that, because of the number it's great it gets really bright. It has awesome, colors, very deep blacks because it's OLED, it doesn't color shift nearly as much as the Nexus 6 when you dim it all the way, and overall, it's a beautiful panel for using the OS web browsing using apps taking photos, videos watching YouTube whatever. Actually, the turbo is one of the first phones. I got to use the new YouTube app on which let me watch the videos in freaking 1440p, so it looks really super crispy. Now a lot of people have complaints that quad HD is just too much on a phone or even unnecessary. We keep hearing that as it could take a hit on battery life. So let's just jump right into that number three is the battery. Now the turbo has a 3900 milliamp hour battery 3900 milliamp hours, that's massive, so you can see it's not exactly a thin device. That'S eleven point two millimeters thick and it's got some curves. You know there's no dimple on the back anymore. It'S just a big flat battery in the back and inside the Snapdragon, 805 and Adreno 420 are more than capable enough to run the software smoothly on the quad HD display. So this combination of hardware has a droid turbo lasting still a long time on battery. Now it doesn't last longer than the best of the 1080p phones out there as you'd expect, despite having a huge battery, but it is pushing extra pixels and it gives you an awesome media experience for an extra long time. So five-and-a-half hours of screen on time is what I get all the time on this one, I'm usually getting about 6 on the oneplus one, which is probably the best of any 1080p phone. So that's really good for quad HD and it's actually the best battery life. I'Ve gotten out of any quad HD phone, including the note 4 to date. So that's super impressive. Obviously, if you have a 1080p display on the front, it would last even longer, but I think this is a nice trade-off and it's a pretty good balancing act and I'm very impressed once again with the battery life of a Motorola smartphone. Now the last major change for the Droid turbo versus the Moto X is the new camera. The turbo is rocking an impressive 21 megapixel camera with dual LED flash, and let me tell you, it is a huge improvement over the Moto X and it's actually, the best camera Motorola has ever put in a phone, not just because of the number 21 megapixels. But it's actually a really good camera. A great sensor, sharpness is on point, as you would expect. Colors and dynamic range are decent, it's not over sharpened or over processed like say a Galaxy s5 or Note 4 photo, but the images you get out of it. Look pleasing it takes 4k video and it's a really high quality, relatively noise free image in anything, but the worst lighting. So, overall, when you take a step back and look at all the changes between the droid turbo when you compare with the Moto X, pretty much everything I've mentioned here is an improvement. The camera is better, the battery is bigger, the display is sharper and better-looking. I mean everything seems like it's taken a step forward and that's why I say the experience of the Droid turbo is top-notch the biggest disappointment actually on the turbo, for me was a speaker on the front. Now it is a front facing speaker - and I love talking about those and how great they are, but it's only one at the top of the phone and it's just a small driver on the left hand, side corner. It'S not a big old speaker like the grille. Might imply it is, and it didn't sound, very good at high volumes at all and you lose that on the stereo audio on the phone is sideways, but even so it adds still take it over any rear-facing speaker. So that's it! It'S a droid turbo. If you're on Verizon it's pretty much between this and the note 4 for best phone, you can spend your money on. So motorola really hit the nail on the head here and i don't really think you can go wrong between the two. But if we're placing bets on which one gets lollipop first i'll put my money on the motorola thong. So there you go guys, that's been it.

vE-P7zzCCsU,Google Nexus 9 Review!,9:39,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here and welcome to the review of the tablet. I waited so long for the Nexus 9. This is going to be a pretty brief review because there isn't really that much different or new about the Nexus 9. Nothing spectacular about it, it's basically HTC's safest bet ever so, the Nexus 9. It'S a 9 inch tablet. It'S running stock, Android, 5.0 lollipop right now, and it's somewhere in between the Nexus 10 from two years ago and the Nexus 7 from last year. So, like I said it's a 9 inch display with this sort of a squarish 4 by 3 aspect, ratio that all the iPads have, and it has the soft touch back, which is extremely similar to actually what we saw in the Nexus 7. It'S not a fancy metal or anything just a layer of thin plastic with a soft touch. Coating on the back, the bit of metal we do get is on the sides, which gives a tablet these flat sides for better grip ability. It even makes one-handed use a little easier for me, but yeah. It'S a thin chamfered ring of metal around the edges. Where you can grip the tablet on that's about it in terms of build quality. It does say the word Nexus on the back filled. In the same way, it does on the back of the phone, the Nexus 6 and the camera on the bag does protrude a little bit, but not enough to make it rock on an even surface, so it still lays flat. So that's fine. The only really noteworthy thing actually about the hardware for me is the buttons which are terrible, they're, awful buttons, they're, really close to flush and super mushy they're, not clicky or tactile at all. If you close your eyes basically and try to press the power button, you wouldn't know when you turned it on or not that's how little click there is and if there is any less travel it would literally be inside the tablet. It'S ridiculous how hard it is to press now. Htc has apparently noted that this is a problem. So if you order a nexus 9 today, you'll actually get a sort of a nexus. 9. 2.0. It'S a revised hardware model with new clicky err, more tactile buttons. So that's good for people who are getting it now, but that's not solving my problem, but one thing that's nice is HTC. Is built-in tapped awake, so you can double tap the display when it's off to wake it up and that'll. I guess help me avoid using the crappy button. Just it's too bad, there's no double tap to sleep, which means I still have to use the button to turn it off, but it's a step in the right direction. Anyway, the rest of the hardware is totally fine up front. You have a nine inch display with the 2048 by 1536 resolution, again the same as those iPads, so that's slightly larger display and pretty average sized bezels make. This tablet, like I said, a bit larger than the Nexus 7 or the iPad Mini, and the display is pretty good. I think it's one of the high points of the tablet. Its resolution makes it pretty sharp, so it comes in at over 280 pixels per inch. There'S very little color shift, it's really saturated and certain overall really good, looking display viewing angles are nice, so overall I give a thumbs up to the panel. The only thing is, it does have a bit of a light leak problem from the backlight. So when it's dark out or when the lights are off or you use this tablet at night, you will notice the uneven lighting and we'll call it light bleeding in from the sides around the edge of the tablet. You can only find this on really low quality panels, but I only really notice it again when it's dark, so it's the only con I found to an otherwise very nice display flanking the display are yes, dual stereo front-facing speakers, these top off the media. Experience of the Nexus 9 very well and honestly they're, not even that great speakers again they're pretty similar to the front-facing ones on the Nvidia shield, they're, not spectacular, but simply placing them on the front, makes them so much better than the iPad or the Nexus. 7. Speakers which are side facing or rear facing so front facing speakers are great. They get loud enough that you can hear from across the room if you're into that it's not boom sound or anything, but I will gladly take it also on the back. You have an 8 megapixel camera, it's good for basically just scanning barcodes. It'S not really a good camera for anything past that it kind of looks similar just looking at it to the Nexus 5. But I don't see a lot of people buying this tablet for the camera quality. So yeah, it's it's there. If you need it, but hopefully you don't need it so yeah. You can tell there's nothing really all that incredible about the hardware of the Nexus 9. Here, it's really all about the software experience. It'S running the latest version of Android out the box and, of course, will continue to be first in line for updates. So when Google releases them here, we have Android 5.0 lollipop as smooth as ever on the 64-bit NVIDIA. K1 chip with two gigs of RAM actually and a lot of what you find here, is really just the phone experience and blown up to a larger display that can also rotate landscape. Not sure, if that's a good or a bad thing that it's moving towards that. Gradually, but I guess it seems like when we first started with Android on tablets. There were a lot more tablets, specific interface tweaks, like the notification bar on the left and the quick settings on the right. But I guess, for the sake of continuity, it's slowly moving back to a more simplified interface that resembles a phone more. But I'd still like to see Android 5.0 take advantage of the larger display in a few more places. Maybe I just need to add more widgets or something I guess since its Android. I can do that either way. I really like Android 5.0 here and pretty much all of the apps I use are here so, if you're coming from an iPad, that story might be a little bit different, but I'm a heavy Google service user - and this is great for me and again performance here - Is really smooth basically as smooth as or smoother than any other Android tablet experience, except sometimes it likes to hang when launching apps like on a blazing fast 64-bit tablet launching the YouTube app it shouldn't. Hang that long, it shouldn't take that long to open up an app. It happened on occasion, but particularly when I'm multitasking a lot and a lot of apps are dropping out of the 2 gigs of ram. But in the past it hasn't really been a problem and everything else has been as smooth as expected and in app performance. 2 is also really smooth. It'S a great media tablet, so I played a lot of games. I was smooth the entire time there no dropped frames same deal with web browsing in Chrome messing around with other tablet, optimized apps. The experience has always been very, very quick and very smooth. So that's great. You also get all the latest and greatest features. So if Google comes out with some fancy new features in Android that roll out tomorrow, people with a Nexus device will be the first to get it I'll, leave a link to my review of Android 5.0 right below. If you want to check that out, there's some good stuff in here useful stuff, like screen, pinning lockscreen notifications and material design everywhere, all these animations, it's all good stuff, and I happen to love it so yeah Nexus. 9. It'S a nice lightweight good performing compact tablet. Running stock Android because of its size, it's like right on the border between and one handed and two handed use it both are really okay. It'S also a bit of a smaller battery. Just to note it's a 6700 milliamp hour battery, so you'll probably charge it every two or three days. Instead of every five or six like with the same usage on bigger tablets, oh and pro tip, if you're choosing between colors still, I would go with the white Nexus 9 and Nexus 6, because the black of the same material is a serious fingerprint magnet. The white doesn't really show fingerprints nearly as much so. At the end of the day, I have some very specific mixed feelings about the Nexus 9. I think, when a lot of us heard that it was going to be made by HTC, we had these really high expectations for the build quality. The last notable thing that HTC made was the One m8 and that phone is known for its build quality and beastly speakers. So a lot of us were expecting this new Nexus tablet to be known for its build quality and beastly speakers. Well, it has decent speakers, but it's built exactly the same really as the Nexus 7 was, if you added metal sides to it. So it's not that special in terms of build and a lot of people are going to have that wake-up call when they finally receive it. So it should be priced lower. It'S a $ 400 tablet right now for the lowest end, 16, gig Wi-Fi only model in the Play Store and for that price it's hard to recommend, because it essentially feels like a slightly larger Nexus 7 and the Nexus 7 was really good for the price. It was known for how cheap it was, so you got to pick somewhere between really well priced and really premium and well built and right now it's not striking that balance. I think this. This is a better tablet to be sold at $ 300 and I think, sooner or later is going to be sold for $ 300, maybe not in the Play Store, but it's kind of hard to sell this tablet for 400 bucks. Also in the Nvidia shield. Tablet is also out there running lollipop with front-facing speakers, the NVIDIA k1, not quite the same 64-bit chip, but very similar specs and a really nice build for 300 bucks. It'S sitting out there cannibalizing sales essentially competing with this Nexus 9, so hard to recommend buying it. For 400 bucks, but if you have to have a Nexus tablet, you have to have the stock Android experience. First, is you don't get a lollipop immediately on the shield tablet, then the software experience is what you would buy this next 9 tablet 4 and that's what I would recommend it for people who are buying this tablet for the software experience. This is not a tablet to buy for the hardware experience, because it's not that great, it's not going to feel like 400 bucks, even the iPad Mini retina is completely made of metal and far outclasses. All of the build quality of the other tablets out there that are made of plastic, so I recommend taking a look at the software experience if you want to buy this tablet. Otherwise there are other. I review the Nvidia shield tablet I'll leave the link to that right below. If you want to check that out too, and there are other options to consider, but you got to have a nexus.

RoAPTdvgAJg,Google Nexus 6 Review!,17:02,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kim PhD here, and it's no secret that I like Android, pure I've, gravitated towards devices running stock Android for the past couple of months or a year. And there are a couple of other devices that have come out for people. With the same preference as me, but the Nexus release, which is roughly once a year, tends to be the one that we wait for the most. So this is the newest one. This is the Nexus 6 and it's basically a big Moto X running stock Android. No, no, like a really really really big Moto X, running stock Android, it's kind of hard to show exactly how big this phone is, since everyone has different size, hands and everyone's coming from a phone of a different size. But if you've ever seen some of the larger phones on the market like here, it is completely concealing the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, which means the larger footprint it has bigger dimensions in every single way. It'S also pretty similar in size to the iPhone 6 plus at least in terms of height, but it's much wider and the iPhone is super thin, while the Nexus 6 is a lot more sloping and rounded, this is actually the first phone I've had that doesn't fit In the cup holder in my car, I've used some like really wide phones before the oneplus one. The Galaxy Note 4 really wide, but this one's just freaking huge and I think the Galaxy mega is the only one. That'S been this massive but yeah. The hardware is essentially a larger version of that moto X with a couple of minor changes which are all good. I think I personally think the Moto X was already one of the better design phones of the year and all the changes made are an improvement over that already great phone. So, besides being much bigger, you also get the dimple from the older moto X 2 years ago, which I actually think was better. It'S a nice soft indentation with a subtle Motorola logo, not the off-color, [, __, ] stamp and the word Nexus is engraved and filled with metal or at least some shiny material that looks like metal on the back. It has the same power and volume buttons from that Moto X, the ridged power button on the side and it's excellent and very clicky and tactile. So these are excellent buttons actually liked that a lot except now they're in the middle of the phone. So pretty far down and that's actually really good for holding it and pressing them with one handed use again. You'Re, probably not going to use this phone with one hand very often, but I think they're in the right spot and you get the same met band. All the way around the phone, which is great for the way it feels in the hand I like using the word rigid to describe it. This is probably the best hardware for this new software which I'll talk about in a bit, but basically the display sort of melts over on to the sides. So it's not a sharp corner, like the note for the glass is curved at the very edges. So you can drag your finger on and off the display with no problem, which means you're dragging things in from the side bars that are all over Android 5.0. And yet you still have that metal Bend to grip on to when holding the phone. And that part isn't slippery, so it's a nice combination of round and flat now the back of the phone is round 2. So that means it's not going to sit still on any flat surface which drives me crazy, a little bit because, basically I text, while my phone is flat on a desk all the time, but that's basically impossible with the Nexus 6. The back isn't even that slippery. It'S a soft touch material, but if you touch it at all, it's going to start spinning and rocking and rotating wherever is sitting so that felt less elegant to me. But it probably won't be that big of a deal for most people and the Nexus 6 also gets dual front-facing speakers. They protrude a little bit, so you can't set it flat the other way either, but something that's we didn't get that at all. In the Moto X we only had one speaker front-facing before here we have two. So we get that stereo image of very loud, clear, directional, sound from all your media and all your games. It'S not quite boom sound in terms of volume or quality. Honestly, the lowest two or three notches of volume are basically silent and the highest to both sound. Like the max volume, but overall it's much louder and clearer than any rear-facing or downward facing speakers, yet they still manage to keep the bezels pretty small and the funny thing about these bezels. So they aren't the same size at all. As you can see, which is funny because we're used to that symmetrical forehead and chin look, but it's a bit smaller on the bottom bezel than the top kind of like the phone is also a little bit thinner on the bottom than the top. Due to that big sloping curve, but these small bezels and front-facing speakers allow for a massive 5.9 six inch, quad HD AMOLED display and that right there is the biggest difference versus the Moto X. This display is crazy, good and very, very sharp at 493 ppi and it's overall really good, probably one of the best in any smartphone, not the best. I would still give that to the Galaxy Note. 4 right now, but I mean it's very bright. Super sharp has those pitch black blacks and awesome saturation and contrast ratios from being an AMOLED display. Viewing angles are pretty good, except for the extremes where it starts to rainbow out, but that's really at the far extremes and colors are pretty good, except when you turn the brightness all the way down, which turns the display noticeably super pink like very pink since there's So much bright white in Android 5.0. You notice this stuff when you're using a phone at night. It makes it so obvious how salmon-colored things look, but some might argue, that's actually a feature, it's better for your eyes. No, it's not a feature. It'S just not quite as color accurate as some other panels. It'S still definitely beautiful, though I mean the display overall, contributes to a great hardware package. The Nexus 6 is quite a nice phone to hold it's technically water-resistant. The back is soft touch. The whole build is, like I said, rigid with that metal. Again, it's really really really big. I know everyone's probably told this to you already, but seriously it's a huge phone, so that gives you a huge canvas for Google to play on with the software. And, of course, this guy is running stock, Android, 5.0 lollipop and Android on this phone has so much new. I mean I feel like the more I use it. The more I uncover new features. I mean you just kind of find new things all the time. Like literally the other day, I visited droid life and, of course, the status bar of my whole phone changed to match the theme on their site, which is something mobile developers can do now with Chrome. Never came across that until today I asleep keep messing with the quick settings all the time, since I use them more and more every day and I keep finding new functionality and new clickable things that happen when you press buttons, one really nice touch which you'll discover Like day one is the quick settings disappear when you're changing the brightness, to give you a preview of the change you're about to make to what's underneath similar to iOS 8 very nice, and there are so many clickable parts to the quick settings now that you can Basically get to almost any setting you want in one or two taps at a time which makes it very fast to use the phone and I've learned all these things really just with a couple of days of using it. There aren't so many big screen optimizations in Android 5.0, like you, might find in a skinned version of Android. Google keeps their design language very universal, so they they don't build things in that. You wouldn't also want to see on a 4-inch phone. Another pretty unique new feature is called ambient display, which takes advantage of the o LED display to show your notifications instead of an LED light and basically the way it works is. When you pick up the phone it'll show you your clock and a black and white version of any of the notifications. You have waiting for you. It'S a very sleek way doesn't use much battery at all kind of pulses in a subtle way, and then you can touch the screen to bring them all to color and interact with them without ever touching the power button. So it's not quite the same as tapped. Awake but since it requires you to pick up your phone to get it going, it's a little bit of an extra step, but I kind of like it and since it's just a software feature. Theoretically, it can be improved with software updates and keep getting better. But we really notice is all these animations everywhere and I did a separate video, an entire video review of Android, 5.0 lollipop and all its features and what's new and what's awesome so I'll leave a link to that right below that like button. If you want to check it out, I talked about all these animations a lot. I think that video makes a really good companion to the nexus review. The thing about performance on this Nexus 6 is there's these animations all over the place in Android 5.0 and those animations are smooth and they move at a really high frame rate. So it feels like the phone is moving very well, but if you take a step back and look at overall performance, it's not all that much better than other phones and it's actually, even though it benchmarks higher than a lot of other phones. It doesn't perform better than a lot of those phones and again. This is mostly because it has all those pixels to push on that quad HD display the overall feel of the OS is buttery smooth all the way through, and I love that it's just that sometimes launching applications, or you see this occasional stutter things just feel like A half a step slow once in a while and you'll notice that, because you didn't see those same stutters on the top of the line, 1080p phones and it again feels like that. First generation, pod of quiet, HD devices, the same way. We had that first generation pod of 1080p devices we're moving up into the performance of everything else and we'll soon see it. I mean I'm sure software updates will continue to improve performance, and I tend to be less harsh on things that I believe can be fixed with software updates and since it's a nexus, it's first in line for software updates, but again in terms of performance. It'S very very smooth, as you would expect out of stock Android. Just don't expect it to blow your mind in terms of being better just because the benchmark score is so high. Now, being huge also gives you all the x-ray advantages of having all that extra space inside and one of them is that huge battery space, so the Nexus 6 at ten and a half millimeters thick with all those curves has room inside for a thirty two hundred Million power cell, so the battery life on the Nexus 6. You would expect, I guess, with Android 5.0 peer stock project, Volta the Android runtime and a 3200 milliamp hour battery. You would expect that with all that, this phone should set a new standard for how long phones should last in your pocket, not this one. We are clearly still in that first generation of quad HD phones, where basically, all smartphones tend to be in this sort of a bubble of roughly average battery life and then quad HD phones are over here sort of moving up into this level over the next couple Of months, but we're still in that first generation and the Nexus 6 battery life is average at best. Now my usage isn't the same as everyone else, but just to give a number my average screen on time at the end of the day after one charge with this guy was about three to three-and-a-half hours of use where, with a 1080p stock, Android phone like the Oneplus one I use for a couple months, I would get more like four to four and a half hours of screen on time. So it'll still last me an entire day, I'll, usually dip into the last 15 percent of the battery. At the end of every single day, so it's not like, I have plenty of battery to spare, but it's a quad HD phone and it clearly suffers from having all those extra pixels to push around in the battery life Department. Now it does have a no LED display and you can save battery there and it has a pretty good standby time. So, if you have a light usage day, you'll be totally fine, but the main way that they essentially remedy this is by having turbo charging. This is a Motorola device, so it came with the Motorola turbo charger, which is essentially just a higher amperage version of a regular charger that this will accept. Any cable will work and it worked really well. It did get pretty warm while turbo charging, but I don't think that harms the battery at all and I'd be surprised by how much charge I could get back by just a couple of minutes of being plugged in. So if I had a particularly heavy day - and I happen to be back near the charger before the end of the day - and I want to juice up real quick just to make sure I get enough - the turbo charging worked fantastic, and at least that was a Bright side of that also, I could swear that the Nexus 6 is supposed to support wireless charging qi wireless charging, but as much as I tried in as much as I tried to Finnick around with the Nexus 5 Qi wireless charger from last year's model, I could Never get it to recognize it or charge at all, so maybe I'm gon na have to buy another charger. Maybe they'll release another Nexus charger this year, but couldn't get that to work. There'S also a battery saver mode that disables a bunch of radios and limits performance and things like that to get you the most editor, last 15 % or so of your battery. But I almost avoided using it since the animations all got super choppy when you limit performance, so I'd rather just pop in the charger for a few minutes and charge up overall battery grade for the Nexus 6. I'D give it something like a c-plus. But again, if you grade it on a curve and compare it to all the other quad HD phones, the note 4 would get that a plus and then Nexus 6 would get something like a B. Also connectivity on this phone is something that's done really well surprisingly. Well, even though it's a little thing, if you're an 18 T customer like I am stick your nano SIM in the top and you have all your bends - get to go plug and play you're a t-mobile customer. Stick your nano SIM in you're good to go! All your bends plug-and-play, you have cellular customer same thing if you're a Verizon customer same thing. This is plug and play with a Verizon nano SIM 2, and it has all those bands which is probably the best way to do it, because we all saw what happens when you try to work with Verizon for Nexus now. Cameras and Nexus phones have never really been a strong suit to put it lightly, there's hope for it every year and it does get better each time, but it's never really an A camera. This time it's Motorola Stern, to give it a shot, and I basically, like I said it's a blown-up Moto X, so you're, looking at the same 13 megapixel sensor here with a ringed diffuser around an LED flash on the back plus that extra space inside is enough Room to add optical image stabilization, so the software to take photos is great, it's very, very fast, getting back to the Galaxy Nexus roots of a near-instant shutter, at least in decent light, but it seems to have some focusing problems in less than decent light. So sometimes I'd tap to take a picture and then it would totally re hunt to find focus again and then snap, but overall taking photos on the huge crispy bright viewfinder hard to complain about that. So, with the photos themselves, the camera is actually better than the Nexus 5, which is good. It should be, and the colors look really good. The sharpness is on point and it's a pretty decent image, most of the time so thumbs up there, it's fun because it actually looks really really good when you're taking it on the phone on looking it on that awesome display. But when you take it back to the computer and blow it up and really inspect them, I can see some of that Motorola image, processing and a little bit of softness, but overall I'm impressed to say the least that this isn't a disappointing camera anymore. At all. There are still a few gripes, though tap to expose for one thing was super aggressive, so if you tap to expose on a dark area, it's going to blow out your highlights with a hot exposure, but vice versa is true too. So if you tap on a bright area to expose, you lose all of your shadows in darkness. So you really want to be careful where you choose to tap to expose with this camera, because the dynamic range is not that great and depending on where you tap, you can end up with two totally different images. But hey you still have HDR Plus, which is great and works very well, and we also still have those other features in the Google camera that people tend to forget about, like the panorama mode which keeps getting better and better. It'S getting better at not only taking pictures but stitching them together without any flaws, so I'm often impressed with the results here and photo spheres which are still really cool and I'll actually upload this one here to Google and link it in the description too. I think it looks really good and you can basically stand where I stood while looking at the photo kind of like the bubble in Google Streetview. But overall you have photos and videos from the Nexus 6 were pretty good way better than just acceptable. So that made me happy it shoots 4k video too, and still has optical image stabilization. So that was great, even though it still had some focus hunting problems once in a while and there's no HDR for video. Obviously so the dynamic range is limited again, but overall, it's good to have and a welcome addition and the photos in anything, but the lowest of low light were very shareable and pleasant to the eye. So I give the camera the most improved award, especially compared to other nexuses, so good job Motorola. Also, I am super ready for the raw photo capabilities whenever they arrive so at the end of the day. Overall, yes, this is a nexus, but we got to keep in mind that this is still a huge quad HD Moto X, running stock Android. That'S the TL DW of this video, and if you like that, if you like that idea or that concept, then you'll love. This phone and the thing is this: isn't this isn't the best quad HD phone right now? I will give that crown to the Galaxy Note 4, with a better display, a better battery life and overall, very similar specs, but you have to deal with TouchWiz on the Galaxy Note 4 and that software is not my favorite in the way it looks at the Way, the way it acts and feels so Android 5.0 here is stock and when you get Android 5.0 on the note 4, it's not really going to look like this. Basically, you have to be really into software and really want Android 5.0. In order to justify this one being a better buy, it is a little bit less expensive too. It'S six hundred and forty nine dollars to start, which is marginally better than some other. Really. High-End phones like this, but this is a phone for the Android heads, the Android purists who don't mind moving to the larger display, even if you don't get any extra optimizations or any crazy bells and whistle features. This is for the people who are really into it. For stock Android and if you're into it, for that this is the best phone you can buy right now, no regrets right there, but again there are plenty of other choices out there for you to decide between. I am comfortable making this my daily driver, at least for now. Well, I think it's one of the best software experiences on any phone right now, but that might change and I will certainly have videos on other phones coming up of tees other things already that I'm working on right now, but that's basically it that's the Nexus 6. So thanks for watching, I hope you enjoy feel free to subscribe. If you want to see more videos like this and I'll talk to you guys in the next one bass, you """
DqVPbEcWtA0,Apple iPad Air 2 Review!,8:28,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here - and this is the iPad air 2 now this can be a pretty simple, relatively easy review video because we saw the iPad air one did a review, video of it last year and overall, as a category, these iPads And basically, any large tablet have sort of slowed down into this iteration year by year. We see them get a little bit better, but there aren't that many drastic changes made. So really the easiest way to show this is to give you a list of the ways. It'S changed versus the iPad air one, so these are all the changes made to create the iPad air 2. So number one is the iPad. Air 2 is thinner and lighter than the first iPad air, so the first one was already really thin and light. But this new air 2 is just 0.96 pounds, so lighter and 6.1 millimeters thin so thinner than any other tablet out there and believe me. That translates really well from paper and just numbers to actual hardware and holding in the hand. So the build of this thing is almost surreal. It'S completely made of metal all around, which is great, and it has rounded sides and chamfered edges all the way around too, and it kind of just feels like the display is attached to almost nothing. As at this point, I mean this is kind of the reason why I say it feels like large tablets are hitting their stride right now. If you show this iPad air to someone 10 years ago, or even five years ago, you'd probably flip out and think it's impossibly thin, there's no way that's real, but it's not just about fitness. The fact that it's also lighter means it's just as easy as any other tablet to hold in the hand, and while it's definitely not a one-handed tablet, it's much easier to hold with one hand and type and poke. With the other hand, when this habit is so light like this, so the side bezels are thinned out a little, but there's still plenty of room to rest, your thumb. So overall, it's really well thought out. I mean the design we've seen it before, and it's sort of set a standard for build quality and it's pretty deserving of the name. The only quirks with this new, thinner and lighter hardware is that the mute switch that's been on the side of every single iPad and iPhone. Since the beginning is now gone. It'S been replaced with a software toggle in the quick settings of iOS 8, and I don't even think that the tablet is too thin for this. It'S just a, I guess, a design decision by Apple, a conscious choice to not have it, but the other downside of going so fin and light is the space inside is a little bit smaller, and that means you have a smaller battery. But the thing is, it's still a great battery life for a tablet. I didn't even notice having to charge it more versus any other iPad. It has great stamina, that's basically all day with any use and has a classic iPad ridiculous standby time, where you can leave it at 85 %, not use it for a week and pick it up to use it and it'll be right, ready, I'd like 82 %. So technically, yes, it is a smaller battery. It'S a 15 % smaller cell coming in at seven thousand three hundred forty million powers - and yes, I should be mad at them for sacrificing battery just to make it thinner again. But it's at the point where I haven't actually yet noticed a difference in battery life. So I guess that's something: iOS on a tablet has going for it now, one of the biggest and best improvements of the iPad air 2 is its new display. It'S still a Retina display and it still has the same 4 by 3 aspect, ratio and 2048 by 1536 resolution still the same great colors and color reproduction brightness levels and everything like that. But it's now a fully laminated display, which actually, ironically, means less air between the glass and the panel. So this and the anti-reflective coating is supposed to give the new screen a much more glare-free. Look like the image is closer to the surface of the glass and I actually thought it pretty. Much seemed like I was touching. The pixels, like the image, was floating right on top of the iPad, as I touched it, and the Retina display looks great, except I already thought that about the old iPad screens. So maybe they all look great honestly, you probably won't be able to tell the difference until you see them side-by-side, actually think time. Ausa'S speed test video accidentally does a really good job of showing a difference between the display on the iPad air 2 and the original air I'll link that below. If you want to watch it. But besides that, I did notice a little bit of a black gap around the edges of the display just a little bit of a gap. It'S something I've noticed other laminated displays have too, and it would be a little distracting sometimes but a lot of times. I just didn't even notice, and it would be less noticeable on the gray iPad, which has black front bezels instead of white. Another improvement with the air 2 is the specs inside. So the air 2 is rocking Apple's new a8x chip, which is their best mobile chip. Yet, by a long shot and without getting too technical, it's essentially a triple core three core processor, and you also now. Finally, for the first time in Apple tablet, history get two gigabytes of RAM. Now the a8x is chip. It'S incredible! It'S super powerful. It'S really thermally efficient. This tablet basically never heats up on me and it powers iOS 8. As smoothly as you'd expect. I mean this no hiccups here. This is iOS 8 at its finest there's, not a whole lot of extra stuff going on. Obviously, it's just a grid of icons, but it better be this smooth in 2014 with specs like this, but on a tablet. I'Ve said this before everything feels like a blown-up version of the phone interface here on the iPad. It'S not really taking much advantage of all those pixels and all that power and with 2 gigabytes of RAM, you would think Apple would find some awesome seriously advanced iPad multitasking stuff to throw in there. But it's still the same interface as any other granted. I'M sure apps will stay open in the background longer without having to refresh but honestly, unless you're doing some heavy gaming or messing with some 3d graphics apps, or something really intensive like that. You'Re, probably not going to notice the spec difference between the air 2 and the original air, even though it is a lot better. So that brings us to the little things. There are just a couple of other little things, sprinkled in there to make this iPad air 2 a really compelling tablet for a lot of people that they'll, hopefully try to get them to spend their money on they upgraded the camera. Now, yes, I know it's rocking an even better 8 megapixel camera. It'S essentially the exact same optics as the iPhone 5s and sure I'll give credit to Apple you're right. The iPad is probably the best camera viewfinder out there. Technically, that's true and as beautiful as it might be to look in front of your face, it still doesn't mean you should take pictures all the time or video with your tablet. But hey the f-15s took pretty good pictures. So now so does the iPad. You also get touch ID now. The thing print sensor over the home button that you can use to unlock the tablet, but it kind of stops short of a lot of potential. I mean there's no NFC, so you can't use it for Apple pay, but there are no multiple account sign ins on iOS, for example, so you can't sign in to a different profile with a different fingerprint stuff. Like that's missing, I guess it's still. The early stages of touch ID technically, but basically it's just for unlocking right now, but it's there and also got to mention that super reflective Apple logo, which was a fingerprint magnet like crazy. But when the tablets clean, that thing is a serious eye. Catcher and the speaker on the iPad, which was very very very loud, so it's actually so loud that it vibrates the entire tablet at its loudest volume and then, when you put it down on a sort of a vibrating surface like a wooden table, the chassis makes It even louder so it resonates through whatever surface you put it on. So it's kind of funny: it's not the best quality in the world and it's still sideways facing, but the loudness was impressive. So, overall, as a whole package, you got ta admit the iPad. Air 2 is pretty sweet, even though I'm more into smaller tablets at the moment, like the Nexus 9 and the iPad Mini and speaking of the iPad Mini the iPad Mini 3, which has come out recently. I didn't even want to touch it or talk about it. At all, but essentially just for those of you who are curious, it is the same exact product as the iPad Mini 2, with Retina display just added a gold version and touch ID. So what this essentially means is the previous version which dropped $ 100 is now a really good deal, and if you want to continue spending full price to get touch ID and gold, that's up to you, but I wouldn't recommend it. I would recommend specifically buying the iPad Mini 2, if you're into a smaller iPad, but I'm also going to be reviewing another smaller tablet coming up soon, the Nexus 9 and a whole bunch of other things I, like I said November, is a pretty busy month for Tech, but has been my impressions of all the stuff, that's new in the iPad air 2 and you can choose for yourself if you think that's worth upgrading, I personally would say hmm for some people, but again it's up to you. So that's been it. Thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace you """
pEDQ1z1-PvU,Android 5.0 Lollipop Feature Review!,8:51,"Bye-Bye hey: what is up guys? I'M could be HD here and I've been using the lpx 13 D build of Android 5.0 lollipop on my Nexus 5 for the past couple of days and surprise. I really liked it a couple weeks ago I showcased an earlier build of Android 5.0, the Developer Preview back on. It was just known as Android L, but now with lollipop. There are a lot of new features, and this build is as close as we have now to Final. So this is a rundown of a lot of the new awesome features that I think people are going to like. So right off the bat two words you're going to hear a lot when it comes to Android 5.0, our material design and while that's an entire redesign of all of Android, you can probably sum it up best in one word, which would be animations. Basically, everything you touch brings something on to the screen or moves it off. So you know exactly where things are coming from and where they're going and that's the whole point. So the straight-up unlock screen here or just unlocking into the dialer, will give you an animation or unlocking into the camera, and you can see the animation shows what you're doing isn't just popping out of nowhere. It'S coming from somewhere and same with the new app drawer. It springs to life out of that button, instead of fading in out of nowhere like before, and you'll see a lot more transitions and animations all over the place in lollipop just like this, so it keeps with the whole theme and I'll actually consider that a feature. It'S legitimately helping with creating an intuitive UI, although it still doesn't help that the back button in Android is still just as inconsistent as it has been in previous versions. But there are a lot more helpful animations that you'll notice. Every time you pick up the phone, which is really cool, and it's also awesome to see these animations really always running at a pretty high decent frame rate, especially since this is a Nexus 5, a 1 year old phone and hopefully Android L on older devices or Lower end ones will still be just as fast at least I hope so so if you're thinking Nexus 6 is going to be too big, looks like Nexus 5 is beginning to look like a steal at under 400 bucks. So, first off there's a new Google launcher. App drawer and wallpapers now all material design themed. If that makes any sense, I already showed you the app drawer animation but check out these new wallpapers. Here too, some of them are pretty sweet-looking and I have my favorites but I'll link a downloadable album in the description right below that like button. If you want to check them out too - and next is the notification area which has also been redone, so you can see all your notifications and obviously all the same functionality as before. But now you have a clear all button which was gone in the previous build. So thank gosh, it's back and you have another swipe down to get into your quick settings or two finger swipe. If you want so you have your brightness slider, which wasn't there before. That was another click away, and you also have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, toggles, etc. Some new stuff here that wasn't in KitKat, you have a flashlight toggle, which is new, very nice and a screen orientation, lock again very useful for many and a screencast button which will allow you to screencast to a TV. If you have a chromecast, also that second swipe down reveals a bunch of information with that smooth animation again, showing you your time, a clickable alarm text, a clickable battery percentage to show your battery settings a clickable shortcut to settings and a profile switcher. So now you can have multiple profiles on Android on your phone, just like you could on a tablet. If you share one, and you can have two people signed in three people signed in or if you want to just let someone borrow your phone for a day or something give him that guest account, which is basically just like. You got a brand new phone, no apps or anything are installed. They can pick their own apps to install and I don't see any of your media and then you can just password protect your main account and you're good. But if you switch back that will actually show you that when you get to your lockscreen, the lockscreen also now shows notifications, which is pretty cool. It'S just like an iOS except swiping them away. Here, doesn't open them and dismisses them. If you want to open one, you actually have to double tap it to open the app so here's another trick with a notification area. You can hold down any notification to see what app is showing it, and then you can go into that app and go the app settings to change whether or not that app can show you any more really useful. If some game keeps pestering you to buy the premium version or something annoying like that, there's also now a shortcut to three different: Do Not Disturb modes when you tap the volume button. So if you leave all that's just normal just continues to show all notifications. Priority will only show the most important notifications and your alarms and when you switch to none that will not let anything through not even alarm so totally silences your phone. So you can pick the amount of time it stays in that mode. So if you set a 45 minute commute, you can have it silence for the hour you're driving and then it automatically turns off. Also, you can choose what priority mode includes, so you can choose to have text messages included or calls included, basically customize it to your liking. I always leave on priority mode when I go to sleep so that the only thing that can wake me up is my alarm. So there's also new look inside some of the stock apps in Android 5.0, the dialer looks very material design II. It'S super round super flat. There are animations everywhere, there's a new in call look. So if you call someone and it looks pretty clean, the one thing I don't like is that the hang-up button is now way smaller. I actually liked it when it was a huge full screen thing, so I can just end a call without thinking, but I guess I'll have to get used to the smaller centered one and there are other little things all around Android. 5.0. Really that you might not even notice for a while even using the phone, a fun one is that the screen off animation is actually very, very slowly fading to black and white before it turns off your display, pretty damn cool, but you may not even notice for A while the new setup process in Android 5 is a lot easier when you first sign into your Google account for the first time, especially if you have two-step authentication. That is a huge improvement. Android Beam now allows you to share any file type where you can. Only really share links and images before and the keyboard and Android is redesigned, and the letter presses look a little bit different from before as well. You can also use NFC or Bluetooth devices like smart watches, for example, as a trusted device to let you bypass your lock password, they call a smart lock and it works very well. I use it with my Moto 360 all the time, and also now, if you have multiple Google Chrome tabs open, all of them will show up as separate activities in your multitasking carousel, so you can open them up or close them by swiping away one by one. In here oh - and you also notice, they kept google search available in the multitasking menu as well. I don't know how useful that is, but it's there now, the new clock Believe It or Not. The clock app changes the color of the background, depending on the time of day. So, if you're in the middle of the day, when of the sun's out it matches the sky and it's all blue at night, it goes dark, purple, etc. I think that's pretty neat and there's now a battery saver mode that prompts you to turn itself on at about 15 percent and once you turn the battery saver mode on your notification bar and bottom nav bar our turn bright orange. So you can't accidentally forget you have the mode on, and this will turn off. Most of your background data turns the vibration. Motor off basically turns your phone into a local media player, but hey it gets you an extra hour or so out of the end of your battery, which can be useful for a lot of people. Now, here's one more really good one screen pinning so let's say your friend wants to borrow your phone and say: hey dude. Let me borrow your phone. I just want to make a call and I trust you friend. I trust that you're going to just borrow my phone and make a call and not buy a $ 3,000 paper shredder on Amazon two minutes later. But if I can guarantee that, if I can guarantee you only use the phone, then that would be really nice. So if you go into security settings and enable screen pinning you can then go into your multitasking app pick the app you want, a screen, pin, let's say the dialer and then you can pin that app to be the only app that you can use. So then, you can confidently hand him your phone, knowing that he can't get out of the dialer or do anything else crazy. He can just call someone and that's it, of course, assuming he doesn't know how to exit screen pinning mode, which is a long press of the back and recent apps button at the same time. But honestly, you probably won't - and I mean imagine, handing this to a kid or something with a game screen pinned that sounds like endless entertainment to me. So in summary, it seems like Android L is coming along really well. I was at first worried about the lighter look. Everything seems to be bright, white or very pale and light looking compared to the total opposite, which would be Hollow of Android 4.0, which was all dark. So it's something we need to get used to, but other than that I'm liking a lot of what I'm seeing in Android L, and I can't wait to see the final final version on the Nexus 6 and the Nexus 9. But until then I'm going to leave it that can't wait to get the new hardware in hand. Thank you for watching leave a thumbs up. If you enjoyed I'll talk to you guys in the next video peace. """
Wwp9eaVVW_8,Apple iPhone 6+ Review!,7:08,"Hey what is up guys and que PhD here - and this is the iPhone 6 plus in my iPhone 6 review. I mentioned that by upgrading to it from an older iPhone. You get a bunch of the benefits that naturally come with a larger display and an overall larger device with the iPhone 6 plus. All of these differences, all the pros and all the cons are magnified they're amplified by an even bigger device. So if you're trying to decide between the 6 and the 6 plus, hopefully I can help you by going over these benefits and drawbacks as someone who's used, both phones benefit number one larger display, so the iPhone 6 plus has a 5.5 inch 1080p display versus the Iphone 6 is 4.7 inch, which means everything you look at on the screen. Everything you interact with the panel that you're staring at all day is bigger, so you get a bigger keyboard for an easier typing experience, especially if you have big thumbs like me, you can watch videos, bigger and game, bigger and browse the web bigger and read more Documents bigger, basically anything consuming media is bigger. It doesn't necessarily show more information, but it shows the same amount of information in a larger and generally more enjoyable way, plus. If you have games and videos that are 1080p, the 6 plus will fully take advantage of them. Now, despite how huge this display is, Apple, doesn't really do a whole lot in iOS 8 to take advantage of the extra real estate besides the extra row of icons and reach ability. So really, essentially, it's just a blown-up version of the iPhone 6 experience, which is fine. I just wish they'd done a little bit more like I mentioned, but one thing you can do on the iPhone 6 plus that you can't do on the 6. Is Home screen rotation anywhere, so you can go 90 degrees to the right or you can go 90 degrees to the left. If you want or sometimes - and I don't even really know why he would do this, but you can go completely upside-down. 180 degrees. In fact, sometimes I end up taking it out my pocket and unlocking it and it's already upside down, and I have to wait for the animation to flip back honestly, I think it's pretty silly. I think they should remove the upside-down rotation, but yeah homescreen rotation is a thing and yeah. You also get a slightly more spaced out keyboard, so it's much better and much more efficient when you're in landscape on the 6 plus complete with its own copy and paste buttons, which is too bad because I never type in landscape benefit. Number to a bigger phone means: you have a bigger space for a bigger battery, so the iPhone 6 plus has a huge 2915 milliamp hour battery. I say huge because it is way bigger than the one in the iPhone 6 and the immense battery life is one of the best traits of the iPhone 6 plus. I can basically guarantee you'll, never kill the whole battery from 100 % to zero in a single day, and you can't say that about many phones - and there have been plenty of times where I do two full days of light use, while forgetting the charger or something Overnight I saw a battery to spare for the second day I typically get 7 to 9 hours of usage or screen on time, but again it's there have been plenty of days where I get way more than that, and I don't use the phone as heavily take. This day, for example, when I was mostly using it as a camera all day and had the six and a half hours of usage with 61 % battery left at the end of the day. Basically, this thing is a battery champ go to sleep with 50 % charge you'll wake up with that 50 % charge standby for days, and the only con here really is that it takes a little bit longer to charge up benefit number 3 optical image stabilization. This is huge. The iPhone 6 camera was already really good, but having more space inside the body of the iPhone 6 plus gives some space for some bigger camera optics, meaning they fit optical image stabilization in the iPhone 6 plus. This is stabilization done with hardware, which is different from stabilization done with software as the actual elements of the lens moving around to compensate for your shaky hand, rather than software stabilization, that a lot of other phones have that doesn't work nearly as well. The result is two things: one, the iPhone 6 plus becomes a low-light beast, allowing the shutter to stay open a little longer to capture more light without blurring the image, and this combined with optical image stabilization makes some of the best low-light shots. I'Ve ever seen from a phone with no flash and to oh is is awesome for video. You can take a super shaky shot and make it seem slightly less shaky or even take a slightly shaky shot and they can seem like it's on a tripod. So you can move around a lot more and have a lot less fear about getting the shot. You want from a fast-moving object or subject. That'S moving all over the place. Basically, the iPhone six-plus now takes some of the best 1080p video from any smartphone and also takes some of the best photos from any smartphone period and as a pixel peeper. I love that so downside number one optimized apps. This is something that's getting better every week, but it's the same situation as the iPhone 6, like I mentioned in the review, but again magnified even more it's a 1920 by 1080 display, and you would think that you know that's a pretty standard aspect, ratio and resolution Shouldn'T have any problems but apps that haven't been updated for this new phone, look, either fuzzy or wonky and weird so developers get on that quick downside number to slipperiness. So this is a big phone. The iPhone 6 plus has rounded edges all the way around, like the iPhone 6, and it's even bigger, so you're gon na have to manipulate it around more often to reach all the corners of the display, especially if you're one handing it which you're probably not, but So this is the one phone where I would really recommend covering it in some way to at least get a better grip or make it easier to hold in the hand I mean at all super thin, rounded slab, isn't exactly organ amah Capel knows that, but they Do have some first-party case options. They have a leather case and a couple colors, which i think looks pretty nice from the video reviews. I'Ve watched so that I will link below my preference, though, as I've said before, is a skin just to change the texture of the device, but not add much thickness at all, so I'll leave a link to that. This is a D brand skin right below again. They have a couple different colors and you can choose which one you, like best from there downside number three bendgate and I'm only including this section, because it seems like anyone who's ever seen. My phone and asked me about the iPhone six-plus always seems to have a follow-up question about whether it bent or not so for the record. No mine hasn't bent, and I don't expect it to because I'm careful with my phone, but listen, it's an expensive electronic device. You paid a lot of money for it don't sit on it, don't put a lot of pressure on it and watch my bendgate explainer video. If you want to know more about that, I got the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 plus at roughly the same time, and I took the Apple in six out the box first and played with it and started using it a lot and set it up. And then I took the iPhone six-plus out the box and immediately knew that I liked it more than the iPhone 6. I don't know if it was the feel in the hand or just the fact that I'm more used to devices this than the smaller iphone 6. Whatever it was, I am one of billions, but I like personally the iPhone six-plus more. So that's why I picked it and that's why I chose it more and you can choose if the benefits that I showed you are worth more than the drawbacks to you. But that's been my overall thoughts on the iPhone 6 plus. So that's been it thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace """
61TAqY03xwk,Apple iPhone 6 Review!,10:44,"Eh, what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here - and this is Apple's new flagship phone for the next year - the iPhone 6. So there's a new design this year for Apple's flagship and, of course the theme here is thin and light. This phone is six point: nine millimeters thin and it's all one piece of aluminum rounded off at the corners. So instead of having the squared off edges like the last iPhone Apple's, rounded off the sides, the phone feels a lot more like the HTC One m8. Now - and this has two effects - the first is that it gives the whole body this seamless feel, if you start your finger on the screen and drag it all the way around to the back of the phone, you won't encounter any seams, it's just one smooth surface, But two is that, since it's so smooth, it's actually a bit slippery to hold, plus it's a little bigger and it's so light that my confidence actually holding and manipulating. This foam in the hand, is dropping every time. But part of me wants to put a case on it, but you guys know how I feel about cases. So a high quality skin will suit me. Just fine and, of course, D brand has a couple of badass skins for the iPhone 6 to help out this grip ability. So I'll leave links to those right below the like button. If you want to check those out highly recommended, but the rest of the build of this phone is definitely awesome. It'S a bit bigger than the last iPhone, but I think it's a much better size now and you only take a few minutes to get used to it before you look back at the iPhone 5s and it starts to look like a toy. It'S obviously a bit bigger than other phones with a 4.7 inch display, since this one has a big little chin for the home button and a big forehead to match. But what's more striking than his size is, I think the thinness again 6.9 millimeters. That is crazy. Thin almost feels too thin and light to be a working phone. It feels almost the same weight as the dummy phone. It'S so thin. In fact, the camera lens on the back protrudes out a bit now this turns out to be not a huge deal since it's coated in sapphire anyway, and it just rocks a bit when it's placed on a flat surface, but that's minor. So this is the first iPhone to move the power button from the top to the side of the phone and that's good. That'S what other bigger phones have been doing for years and that's much easier to reach and also it has a physical mute switch, and I think that's a nice touch most. Don'T do this yet, but sometimes got switched off in my pocket every once in a while, but I like the physical mute button, so I have a few mixed feelings overall about the build of the phone, since it's so razor thin, but it's definitely built well. It shouldn't bend in your pocket or anything. Actually, I think the worst quirk about the hardware is the speaker on the bottom. It'S a pretty loud speaker, I mean it's got decent mids and highs and it's a little bit tinny. But the thing is it's a small downward facing driver, so it's really easy to accidentally block it when you're holding the phone watching a video or playing a game. Now I know that often in the room right now is the iPhone 6 plus, which is the companion' 5.5 inch iPhone that Apple released alongside the iPhone 6 a couple of weeks ago, and basically my opinion on that is this day, I'm gon na review it separately In a completely different video and that's upcoming, but if you're trying to decide between the 6 and the 6 plus consider this all of the factors that make the iPhone 6 a little bit slippery and a little bit difficult to hold in the hand or amplified on The iPhone 6 plus it's an even bigger phone in every single way, and it's still rounded on the edges. So it's even more difficult to grip. The easiest way to see this is to go into an Apple store and hold one, but trust me, the 6 plus is huge, so really, besides, improved internals the main physical advantage to this iPhone 6 over an older iPhone is the size it's a bigger screen, and It has all the advantages that naturally come with having that bigger screen, so bigger icons, bigger UI, bigger text, bigger web browsing, bigger gaming, bigger video watching bigger keyboard, but what's funny is it stops there, so the iPhone 6 has a 4.7 inch 1334 by 750 IPS Display with awesome, colors and great brightness and incredible viewing angles and a pretty high pixel density 326 PPI makes it the same as the iPhone 5 and 5s and iOS 8 is trained to take advantage of every inch of this display by basically scaling everything up from The iPhone 5s but, like I said there, aren't really any extra features in iOS to take advantage of the larger display, so there aren't no multitasking features or anything extra. There is apples, interestingly, implemented reach ability, which is basically to make one-handed use easier. So you can double touch the home button to move the UI halfway down the display, so you can interact with the top half of stuff. I sometimes use this to reach those top corner buttons and apps, or pull down the notification bar when I'm feeling lazy but yeah. That'S about it as far as apples, extra features for a big screen go again, it's a great display. I just I guess I wish they just did more to take advantage of it maybe show more apps in the multitasking menu make touch targets bigger and first-party apps things like that. They don't have to force anything, but I just wish they'd been more with all those extra pixels, but the rest of iOS 8 is very familiar to anyone. Who'S ever used an iPhone or an iPad before I really don't have to explain that you have some improvements to the notification area. So now you can add widgets just to the notification area. That'S stay there and permanently show information, so you can get more apps from the App Store to fill up this panel with different widgets that show info, and you can you can kind of mess around with these and get shortcuts and real-time stats and info and stuff And that's nice, but you can only have them like. I said in this today, section or notification panel, but overall you have a nice layer of gloss over the top of a very familiar user interface. It'S pretty DUP with this gloss and reflections all over the place. I still like iOS a lot, even though it's a bit restricted in terms of where I can share too and how I can get into Google services, but it seems like every new version, there's a flash of something that makes the OS a little more appealing. Speaking of flash there's a highlight of the new iPhone, and that is the camera on the back. Actually, the camera is always a highlight of the new iPhone, but that doesn't mean we should take it for granted. The iPhone 6 has a great camera, one of the best and one of the fastest in any smartphone. I think that's a key word here towards making the camera so great. It'S extremely fast, so use your interface is fast. Taking a picture is really really fast. It can take high frame rate fast, video at 30, 60 or 720p, even 240 frames per second. It has fast autofocus with this new technology. It has a fast wide, open, aperture glass for great low-light performance and now it's still an 8 megapixel camera. But on that 130 inch sensor, it's kind of like a hybrid between HTC's, massive ultra pixels and Samsung's cramming as many pixels as possible mentalities. Maybe this is the middle ground that we were asking HTC to all along all the photos it takes are very clean. The camera tends to have a bias towards a faster shutter speed kind of like the oneplus one to avoid blurriness. So it's willing to crank up the ISO and just trust its top-notch image, processing to clean things up, and that's really where it's separated. It has great image processing, and this does a pretty good job of cleaning up noise, which makes some crispy clean shots with excellent color. The only downside of this camera, I would say, is the fact that it's only 8 megapixels, which means no 4k. Video 4k, is actually 8.3 megapixels. So this 8 megapixel sensor means this iPhone will not shoot 4k video until the next one. So overall, like I said before this whole phone is a very familiar phone, a safe upgrade for previous iPhone users for sure, if you just straight-up, look at the numbers, you'll see a 1.4 gigahertz dual-core chip and one gig of ram, but the thing performs, like any Other phone with a 2.5 gigahertz chip and three gigs of ram, so you can bank apples, vertical integration and the awesome a8 chip for that so with the iPhone 6 you're getting a great performer, a great camera, a great display and a great design. All in a super thin package, so with a super thin phone, you also get a super thin battery, so the iPhone 6 is rocking a 1810 milliamp hour battery on paper. That'S really small, and you might consider that super small by other phone standards by Android phone standards by other flagship standards by other 4.7 inch phone standards, but Apple, has the advantage of at least it owns that AAA chip it has iOS under control. Everything is optimized to give it the longest battery life possible, so I would summarize by saying it has, but about 10 to 15 percent better battery life than the iPhone 5s. It'S not amazingly great, but it's not bad. It has the advantage of having a really good standby time. So, if you don't use it a lot during the day or if you have a light usage day, you'll probably make it throughout the day not having any problems. You can go to sleep with 100 % battery forget to charge it and wake up with 98 %, so that's great, but on a heavy day, if you're doing a lot of web browsing a lot of photo and video taking a lot of video watching a lot Of gaming, if you're doing a lot of stuff where the screen on time is high during that day, you're - probably not going to make it to the end of the day and you're gon na, have to go, find a charger before the day is out. This is not different from the iPhone 5s. This is just something that comes with having a small, thin phone and apples totally fine with making that sacrifice. I just wish the phone was a little bit thicker, so they could fit. Maybe a 2000 or 2100 milliamp hour battery and that would make the phone yes a little bigger at, but it would get rid of the camera protrusion and might make it a little bit easier to hold. But that's all stuff, I've said before, but look there's one more thing: iOS isn't perfect, there are hiccups, sometimes there are bugs. Sometimes there was that 8.1 update that freakin bricked the phone, but they quickly fix that. But this is the first time in a while that I've seen a significant lag in major developers getting their apps updated to iOS 8 on this bigger iPhone, especially the 6 and the 6 plus apps that haven't been updated for this larger display. Look big and awkward and fuzzy and strange - and I hope, devs get on that to fix their apps and then and only then I will have basically nothing except the battery to complain about in the iPhone 6, so solid phone apple. So my overall final verdict, obviously as a heavy Google service user, Google user, a YouTube user, a gmail user, Google Tasks, Google keep Google Calendar all these things, iOS, 8 and iPhones aren't my first choice. Obviously, but my choice of iPhone is also not the iPhone 6. It'S the iPhone, 6 plus and I'll be talking more about why the iPhone 6 plus is my iPhone of choice in that full review video, but for right now the iPhone 6 is a safe step forward. It'S a it's a definite upgrade from the last iPhone but, like I said, not a mandatory upgrade so stay tuned for that 6 plus review video and many more forward videos to come. Thank you for watching this one and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace. """
SlTvgY9PeCQ,Samsung Galaxy Alpha Review!,4:48,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kip EHD here and today we're taking a look at the Samsung Galaxy alpha now when I first saw the commercial for this phone, I was first released by Samsung, showing off the metal build and how it can stand up on its Own on its side and all these other special things, my first reaction and I even left a comment on the video was meh. I mean it looks like very similar to other Samsung phones and its might even look like a mini Galaxy Note, 4 or a slightly improved galaxy s5. But I said meth because it's so similar to a lot of other Samsung phones. But now it's officially coming to the United States, which means we're gon na - have to take a closer look at this, because this is going to be showing up in stores right next to the Galaxy Note 4 and the galaxy s5. So, let's take a closer look at what makes the Samsung Galaxy alpha different, which means this is going to be a shorter video, because the list of things that makes the Alpha different from phones like the galaxy s5 and note 4 - it's pretty small, but the big Focus here is obviously the material choice and the feel in the hand. That'S the whole point of this phone. The whole reason it exists and the main way they've done, that is by adding a metal band all the way around the frame of the phone where they use plastic before so now, whenever you hold the phone you're holding metal - and that makes a really big difference In the way it feels and that band is chamfered everywhere, it's chamfered all the way around the power button is chamfered, the volume buttons are separated and chamfered and they're very clicky. The build of this guy is really really improved now and actually reminds me of the iPhone 5s in a lot of ways. Everything is chamfered, but the thing is, it feels very premium from the front and from the sides, but you flip it over to the back and suddenly it's the same old Samsung again. It'S plasticky soft touch, removable back, just like the older phones and don't get me wrong. Removable is great. You get access to the removable battery, there's no additional storage, but you know I'm not saying it doesn't feel sturdy when it's attached to the back of the phone, but the material itself that you're constantly touching on the back does not feel nearly as premium as the Metal that surrounds it, it kind of seems confused, doesn't like. Does it really want to go all the way to being a premium, feel or only go part of the way, and it's actually kind of the same story with the specs of this guy? Actually, this was the first Samsung Galaxy alpha into the United States, completely thanks to 28 check out my Instagram date for proof, and it had some pretty beastly specs. So this is a Korean model. It has LTE a it's an octa-core processor. It has 2 gigs of RAM all your usual sensors, gyroscope, etc. But then it drops to a 12 megapixel camera on the back. Instead of that new-and-improved 16 megapixel 1 in its brothers and a 720p pentile display, that's not really as good as other 4.7 inch display. Phones, this display is, you know, it's OLED and yes, it's very vibrant and saturated and it does get pretty bright. So it's kind of pleasing. But when you look up close, it definitely breaks down. It'S not a high-end panel and again leaves you with this incomplete feeling about whether it's supposed to feel fully premium or just partially premium, but that's not going to stop a lot of people. This device is still great still feels great still looks. Great performance is also really smooth when you combine, of course, that high-end chipset, high-end, graphics, 2, gigs of ram and a 720p display, and overall the software experience is very similar to the galaxy s5 you've, probably already seen it has a very similar feature set as well. I really like the size of the phone very good, fit in the hand, with a 4.7 inch display, since it's a bit smaller than the iPhone 6 thanks to its thinner bezels. So it's clearly not a full-on flagship phone. It has an 1860 milliamp hour battery and a battery life similar to the Moto X, and it's not a flagship with the slightly bumped down 12 megapixel camera. Even though megapixels don't mean everything it's a older sensor, but yet it has all these other nice specs, and this really really big emphasis on the quality of the build. This premium feel in the hand - and you know, it'll - compete with top of the line phones. It'S almost like a hybrid between the high-end super premium stuff and the Samsung feel of last year, almost like a bridge between these two and honestly. This phone gets me more excited about the Galaxy Note 4 than it does about itself. So, at the end of the day, the Alpha is definitely an improved phone. No doubt it's significantly better feeling in the hand, I would say then the galaxy s5, and I think it's probably one of my favorite phones just to hold in general something about that 4.7 inch screen. Size also appeals to me a lot, but at the end of the day my reaction is still met because, like I said it's so similar to these other phones - and I happen to like big phones, so I'm going to get my hands the Galaxy Note. 4. Very soon, anyway, and probably do a video on that ranting, a little more about how I love the metal so much, but either way that's my my review of the Samsung Galaxy alpha. Hope you enjoyed it. Thank you for watching I'll talk to you guys in the next one bass. """
BK3YvlOFRTg,Moto X (2014) Review!,10:46,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm cabby HD here - and this is the 2014 Moto X or the new Moto X. If you remember the last Moto X this guy, it was a pretty popular phone for a lot of people who were into tech because it made us realize that not everything is about specs and you can make a really great phone that doesn't have the highest end. Specs, so this didn't have a 1080p display. It didn't have the most expensive fastest processor in the world, but it delivered a pretty sweet experience that a lot of people liked and that's what it was famous for this new Moto X is again taking a very similar approach. It'S not the highest end phone in the world: it's definitely not the most expensive, but it does a lot of things about the experience right at least Motorola's opinion and they've made some subtle changes to the software and hardware experiences with this second revision. So, let's take a look at if it's worth it and if it's better than the old moto x now aesthetically, just looking at the outside of the hardware, this new phone will seem pretty familiar. It has the same shape, same lines, same curves and same feel on the hand, as last year's Moto X even has that same dimple. Although this time it's bigger and it's made of separate pieces that fit together and for some reason, the pieces in mind didn't quite fit together perfectly so the dimple moves around a bit. I don't know if that's supposed to happen, but anyway it's clear that we are working with essentially the same design here. The button placement on the side is also the same as the old phone, with a bit of added texture on the power button, which is neat, and it feels basically like a stretched-out Moto X, and it also looks that way. But then there's the addition of all the metal, so all the way around the phone. You now have this metal lining and it makes a huge difference for build quality and the way it feels holding it. It'S a bit heavier as well, but that's a small price to pay for the fact that it feels so much better. So much more solid in the hand - and I love that the metal frame is now also housing. Some new antenna that were in the inside of the phone before and overall its built just a lot better than its predecessor. Of course, you can also have moto maker and a bunch of different color and material choices and accent colors from regular soft touch plastic to wood to leather. Now one thing I want to recommend is: I think we would want to stay away from the leather back. One, unless you really have to have it be coming, this is the black plastic back. So it's not the leather, the leather, it's a softer material. Basically, all of the leather moto X's that I saw when I was playing with them in Chicago were very worn, and I don't know how long they were using them, but none of them looked like they were in any good type of condition. Well, there is a softer material that wears much more easily and plus it's not exactly friendly when it gets exposed to water. So if such plastic on the back actually almost feels the same as the leather, until you start to press down on it and it doesn't have that genuine leather smell and it might not feel quite as premium but I think we'd be pretty satisfied with pretty much Any of the plastic backs now on the front of the phone. The Moto X has some interesting hardware. It'S rocking a 5.2 inch 1080p display it's an AMOLED display and much larger than the 4.7 inch of the old Moto X, and it's a tiny bit warm and a whole lot saturated I've used. I guess so. Many IPS displays lately that coming back to this AMOLED display just reminds me how well oh le D, stuff pops with massive contrast and awesome saturation. So the colors are really vivid here, pops right off the screen and you can tend to make images look better than they really are on this screen. So I like the display and flanking the panel on the top and the bottom, our front-facing speakers. Well, speaker, it's a bit deceiving. You have a grill on the top and a grill on the bottom, but the top is only the earpiece or calls, and the bottom is the only speaker. So it means that you won't get that stereo. Effective sounds moving across the screen, like you would on a stereo phone like the HTC One. I mean there's still better than if it was a downward facing or rear-facing speaker, but it's not quite as good as I thought it would be, and it's you know it's still quite loud: it's decent better than average. It'S just a little awkward. Only having a sound come from half of the phone, but also looking at the front. You can't actually see these with your eyes, but the camera picks it up. Anyway, it's the array of infrared sensors across the front of the phone, and it's packing a bunch of these. You can see them blinking in each corner and basically these are sensors that are talking with a chip in the phone to be able to tell when you wave your hand over the phone, so it can show you your notification glance. That'S actually it that's. What they're, for I mean it's a seriously dedicated sensor array and you can even see them better in the white version of the phone, because there are little holes behind the plastic at each corner, but yeah. It'S a software feature that Motorola felt was important enough to spend a little extra on, but speaking of the software, the story here is also familiar to the last Moto X in the best possible way. Last year, Motorola tried really hard to keep Android as close to stock as they could, and they did did you know they didn't add any unnecessary crap. They avoided the bloatware. They moved to updating as fast as they can a lot of stuff. They move to the Play Store and this phone continues that trend, and I love it so so many companies are trying to add value to their phones via software, which I get, but the adjustments they make are sometimes just change for the sake of change or some Crazy features that people will never use Motorola has done. Basically, none of these few adjustments that they have made have also been really helpful. One of them is now the ability to name your phone anything. So you had to say: ok, Google, now before that, doesn't wake up my phone, because I've actually told it to respond to ok, Jarvis and I think that's a neat. Little touch. Another adjustment versus last year is in the peak notifications. So, instead of only being able to see one at a time, you can now scroll sideways and peek between more than one notification. That by itself is awesome and Motorola has rebranded and simplified a lot of their other commands so that moto assist and moto actions and moto display all kind of work. In the background for you so, for example, little reader text, I live when you're in a moving car. Instead of you know some of the crazy outlandish features, other guys are doing and another benefit of being so close to stock Android is the performance, is damn impressive. It might not be the highest end processor in the world: it's a Snapdragon 801. It might not be the most ram in the world, it's you know two gigs and it might not be the best graphics chip in the world, but the performance of this phone is right up there with the best in the world of all the Android phones. I'Ve used and I've used a lot smoothness and the graphics and fluidity of the Moto X is right up there in, like the top three, with the Google Play edition, One m8 and the oneplus one and even beating out Nexus 5. I mean this thing is really smooth. So if you couldn't already tell I'm a huge fan of the software experience on the new Moto X and I'm pumped to see how it will do running, Android, L, hopefully really soon, the other only problems you have and they're not even really problems they're more. Like trade-offs are the battery life and the camera, and I say these are trade-offs only because, even though this is technically Motorola's highest end phone and their flagship showcasing the best they have to offer, it's still only a $ 99 phone on contract and $ 4.99 off Contracts so again, it's technically speaking, not super high-end and the first place it shows is the battery it's meh. You know it's only a slight slight bump from last year. It'S a 2300 million power battery now but like the screen is so much bigger and higher resolution. Now that you would think they'd bump the battery more and I feel like with a phone this thick they'd have room for it, but nope just 2300. So I'm getting two and a half hours of screen on time with my normal use, where I typically get three to four on other high-end flagships and it's a sealed in battery, so you can't replace it so again, it's it's not really a problem. It'S not like! It'S dying before the end of the day or anything, but it's a trade-off to the point where I start to alter my use towards the end of the day. To make sure I don't run out, and also I mentioned the camera, so it has that nifty little twist to open gesture that I use all the time. I love that and similar to last time, some very, very simple software, just tap the viewfinder to take a picture. You know the menus are super simple. You can swipe them in and out really easy to get to. The viewfinder takes up pretty much the whole screen, but the optics are a little bit interesting. So it's a new 13 megapixel sensor. That seems like a good number and it has this ring flash around the glass now which is supposed to be in theory. I guess a bigger flash spread, but it's too small to actually matter. It'S really just two LEDs inside a ring shape reflector, but when it comes to photo quality, the number doesn't really mean much. This phone is super hit or miss I've been taking photos for weeks now, with this guy and a lot of times, the pictures are really not bad. You know, and bright outdoors and even normal indoor light. This camera can handle anything well. It looks a lot of times like a photo that came from an LG g3 or another high-end phone, but most of the misses and it does miss quite a lot are coming from when you try to take a picture with like a foreground subject and you tap The screen to focus, but then it just takes the picture instead of refocusing and another miss is low-light. Basically anytime. You think you might need a flash forget about it. It'S not good in low wait. It just isn't taking good images. I found I've tried many different ways that won't do it, but the 4k video, on the other hand, is actually pretty good. I was comparing it side-by-side with another phone that shoots 4k video and they looked about the same so that was encouraging. But one thing about 4k, though, is if I switch to 4k in the camera to shoot and then close the camera app and then open the camera right back up again, it's back to 1080p. I actually want to be able to keep 4k on all the time, but I can't either way the camera is just not a high point on this phone. It'S definitely not going. You know, overall, to take quite as good images in the same range of conditions as other high-end smartphones and, like I said, the battery isn't quite as good either so they're trade-offs because, as Motorola's high-end phone, this moto X is going to be compared to other companies. Highest end phones and those are the areas where it falls short, but really when it comes down to it, I just really like using this phone. I love that they didn't try to do too much with the software they're sticking to their guns of that pure Android experience, and I think that will help them get updates faster, that'll help. You know not have so much unnecessary, confusing crap and that's great, and so that plus a similar design to last year and curves that match last year's phone. This is a very comfortable step forward. Doesn'T really stick out too much, not too flashy it just it gets the job done. It'S a great phone, solid flagship for Moto. Just don't forget the price when you go, comparing it to the other guys. So that's my Moto X, 2014 review. It'S still an awesome phone and I was still recommend it for anyone who likes what they see in review. Videos like this, but good luck finding it and I hope you get your hands on it. If you really want it so either way, that's minute!

X8DOUSGGw10,Moto 360 Review!,10:53,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here, and what you're looking at is one of the most highly anticipated devices of 2014. This SmartWatch is the Moto 360. Now there are a lot of varying opinions on smartwatches in general as a category, but this 360 is one of the most important ones and it starts right off with the name: Moto 360. It'S a circular, shell 360 degrees all around well, not quite 360. There'S actually a small bezel at the bottom that just cuts off a bit of the display, but other than that it's essentially a circle. Now some people hate this little bar at the bottom. They say it's distracting and it's a design flaw and even a deal-breaker, but I found that a lot of people saying this haven't actually used. The watch pass just looking at it for a little bit and I found that your eye really starts ignoring it. When you get to use a watch for a bit - and I really hardly notice anymore - even though obviously it's still there so for the record, this little bar is kind of necessary for Motorola. To achieve this design behind it are the display drivers and digitizer and the ambient light sensor which have to go somewhere and, in all other smartwatches, we've seen it's in the form of a thicker, bezel and personally I'll. Take this thin profile with the bottom bar any day, so the result of this design decision is a beautiful watch. It'S made of metal all around its ip67 certified. It'S really well constructed so dust and water resistant, so no worries in the rain and the thing is not nearly as heavy as it looks. I know it's made of metal, but all the electronics inside are pretty light and it's a leather band. The metal ones are coming later for about $ 80 extra, so this one overall is pretty light at 49 grams, so it's actually very manageable. Now the thing is the size on your wrist thing is very polarizing, so I found for a lot of people. You know I gave it to my mom, who has pretty similar sized wrists to me thin. I guess, and her immediate reaction was okay. This is way too big to wear. Watch, I'm not going to wear this, but you give it to someone like my buddy Lou from unbox therapy, who wears a relatively massive g-shock watch all the time on a much larger wrist. Switching to a moto 360 makes it look tiny, so dainty and unacceptably small. So it's something you got to get used to for sure. It'S a 1.5 6-inch display. I know I'm not coming from wearing any watch previously, so it feels pretty comfortable on my wrist. I got used to it pretty fast, but there are no to size options like the Apple watch, so you'll have to make this one work. Also, this is the black version, there's also a silver version as well. And yes, if you wear it out enough, you will get asked if it's an Apple watch. Actually, you can put an Apple watch homescreen on the 360 and it has a functioning clock and everything which is pretty funny I'll leave a link to that below. So the only underwhelming part of the watch's Hardware is the display. It'S ok, it's 1.5 6 inches diagonally. As a circle, and has this beveled edge around the circumference of the Gorilla Glass - and it looks interesting, I guess, but it might have looked even cooler with this seamless edge and the resolution is 320 by 2 90. So not a very high pixel density at all. You can easily see the pixels if you look for them, I guess, but the good thing is that it's an IPS display, which means it's pretty visible outdoors, it's much brighter than if they'd use an OLED display. So in pretty much all but direct sunlight. You can see this thing clearly much more so than if they'd use OLED, so I'm happy with their choice. So the software on the Moto 360 is the same as other smartwatches. Like we've seen in the LG G watch and Samsung gear live it's Android, wear 1.0 and I'm actually I've covered Android wear much more in depth in a separate video I'll leave that link right below that like button, so you can check it out. It'S essentially your Android phones, notifications and Google now cards on your wrist now this is a bit different because it's a circular display, of course, so you have Motorola circular watch faces and a lot of round elements in Android. Wear that really just look better on a circular display. The thing is, there are also parts of Android wear that look better on a square display, so sometimes notifications text will get cut off a little bit in the corners when you're trying to scroll up and read them, I mean usually it does a pretty good job Of not cutting off any of the graphics, but it's not flawless and I feel like. Maybe we could see a split down the road of Android wear for round displays and Android wear for square displays as much as that would suck now. The number one thing people have asked the most about with the Moto 360 is the battery life. So here's a scoop on the battery of the Moto 360. The TLDR is it's. Ok, it's not bad, but it's definitely not great. So it's a 300 or 320 million power battery, depending on who you want to believe, and it's a pretty large screen. One point: five. Six inches compared to the battery size and for that reason, every single minute of screen on time you have what these watches counts a lot. Now a lot of people have been reviewing. This watch have been using it a lot. Oh, I got to test it a lot. I got to make sure I get the battery life checked out and when you use it a lot, in fact, more than average you're going to take a massive hit to the battery now I think I get more notifications than the average person I get plenty of Twitter notifications, Google, notifications, Gmail stuff - I have pretty much everything turned on, so I get calendar stuff tasks all these reminders all day. So it's going off and it's working the way. I guess a normal SmartWatch should, and I tend to end the day, with around 30 percent to 20 percent battery remaining on a heavier day when I'm turning the screen on more when I'm using Google Maps Navigation directions on here. When I'm checking my heart rate, when I'm checking my steps when I'm using all these ok, Google commands and turning the screen on over and over again is listening to my voice a lot and the screen is on a lot and those days I'll end with maybe 10 percent battery left or less, but my day goes from 7 or 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. the next morning. So if you can bear with it lasting 17 18 19 hours before you have to charge it again overnight, then that's fine you'll charge it every night. Now, a big factor in this is whether or not you have ambient mode on the difference between ambient mode on and off is when ambient mode is off. You check the screen, it'll show you the time and after a few seconds, it'll disappear and the screen turns back off again and it's pretty sensitive in terms of knowing when you bring it up to your face. Obviously, you can't really sort of glance check it because it doesn't really know when you're bringing it up to your face or not. But when you very deliberately look at the watch, it clearly turns the face on and you can check the time and your notifications before it turns off a few seconds later. If you turn ambient mode off - and it warns you when you do this - that this will take a massive hit on battery life, but when you turn this off it'll leave the screen on but dimly on forever indefinitely. So that's a lot more screen on time and if you leave ambient mode on, you will not get nearly as much battery life as you would. If it was off default out of the box, ambient mode is off and I think that's recommended. I wouldn't really suggest leaving the clockface on, especially because it's so dim, you won't really be able to see it anyway, so you might as well have the face off and save battery. I say: leave ambient mode off you'll get a full day, but if you turn ambient mode on, you will not get a full day. The one really nice thing about the battery, though, is because it's so small: it charges really fast. So if you get home at the end of a workday you're going to go out that night and you throw it on the charger for half an hour, you can get a lot back into the battery and easily have enough to go for the rest of the Night - and the next thing is, the charging mechanism is pretty awesome. It is officially qi wireless charging, so you can use any old wireless charger. You have maybe your nexus one lying around, which is great, but the dock it comes with and the retail packaging is sweet. You put it on the dock, it glows very dimly with the time and your battery percentage remaining, which makes for a nice alarm clock and it looks cool as hell on a desk. I'M a fan of the charging, so I did mention the ambient light sensor is in that bottom bar. That'S one of several ways to use the watch when ambient mode is turned off. You can number one press the power button on the side to wake the display. Number two: you can tap the display anywhere to wake it up. I found myself actually doing that way, the most often and then number three. You can raise the watch up to your face and the gyroscope will detect that you've raised it and it'll light up the display, and then you have the ambient light sensor, which is what you can use to just cover the face of the watch for a second And that will dim the display for you when you're done looking at it. So here's something weird about the SmartWatch performance is very hit-or-miss sometimes, and this key word is sometimes it's flawless. You know super smooth, never hiccups and is totally fine but other times, and it's like 50/50 all the times. It'S really stuttery and drops frames and lags and is janky. And yes, it is new software, Android wear 1.0 and it's not even a high end chip. It'S a TI OMAP 3, but it really makes me wonder what would have happened if they went with a higher resolution display most of the performance problems. I'M seeing with the Moto 360 happen right when I turn the screen on for the first time makes me think that there's some throttling going on when the screen is off to save some battery so that as soon as the screen turns on, and if I try Doing action too quickly, the processor hasn't throttled back up yet, and it's still kind of in this dormant mode, and that's why I'm seeing lots of choppiness and lots and lots of dropped frames. The animations are all there. It just takes a second before they kick in and smooth themselves out, which seems like a problem with the hardware more than the software. But again this is also first generation Android where software, so it's probably a little bit of both. So the summary of it right now for the Moto 360 is really the summary for smartwatches general smartwatches as a whole are not ready for primetime they're, not like a full, complete compelling package for the majority of people. Yet that being said, this is the best one. You can get the Moto 360 is the best SmartWatch you can get. In my opinion, I've used a bunch of them I'll continue to use more of them and test more of them. I want to check out the LG G watch. Our I want to check out the Apple watch, so there are some other things I want to test, but this is the best one. I'Ve used by a little bit if you're willing to go form over function, meaning you like the way it looks enough to deal with the fact that there are some performance issues and you have to charge it every night and it only works with Android phones. If you like the way, it looks enough to deal with all that, then this is great. This is an awesome SmartWatch and I wouldn't blame you for buying it. It'S $ 250, it's not cheap, but it's also not the most expensive SmartWatch out there either. I will continue to wear mine because I want to see where Android wear moves in these next few weeks and months. There are some updates coming out, and I know that the Moto 360 will basically be first in line for those and assuming that these software updates are good and they optimize battery life and they take care of some performance issues and they work on other differences between The circular and square interfaces, then this will probably end up being a pretty sweet package and I'm glad I got it and I'm glad I have it now so that I get to observe these changes. So thank you for watching. This has been the Moto 360 review. If you want to leave a thumbs up below, if you enjoyed, that would be great and I'll talk to you guys in the very next one peace you """
PNp2IjVv3HI,NVIDIA Shield Tablet Review!,7:37,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here and over the past couple of days, I've been asked a lot about the Nvidia shield tablet. Now, if you've seen any of the ads or if you know anything about this, it's basically a gaming tablet. A lot of people are buying this specifically for the gaming features, and it's really good at that. But if you know me, I'm really not much of a gamer at all. I don't play that many games on my phone or tablet, but I didn't want to ignore this, just because I don't game, so I decided to check it out. I picked it up anyway, and I've been using it a lot and turns out when you take away a lot of the gaming features and a lot of the stuff that it's really good at for gaming. It just becomes an 8 inch, pure Android sort of a Nexus 8 kind of tablet. So this is a short video just going over the stuff that you'll get on this tablet. If you don't game kind of proving that it's a good tablet, even without those awesome features, let's take a look. So, first of all, this shield tablet is made by Nvidia and, besides all the awesome accessories, it works with and all the other cool gaming tricks. It has, it has some pretty beastly specs, so it's packing Nvidia's latest and greatest k1 chip inside so a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core processor, 192, core GPU, 2 gigabytes of RAM 16 gigs of storage and all the rest of the hardware is geared towards showcasing that new k1 Chip, in fact, that's really what this whole tablet is all about, so nothing too flashy going on with the design. It'S pretty compact. It'S got a pretty solid weight to it, a bit heavier than the Nexus 7 and just small enough that I can hold it with one hand. Although I guess most people will two-handed since it is bigger than the Nexus 7. But I got ta say the build quality is pretty decent again, it's not the best build in the world, but you can see it's it's solid. It'S got a pretty standard array of ports, headphone jack, USB and HDMI on one side with a speaker, port and the other speaker port on the other side and speaking of speakers. Yes, this is one of a few tablets, just a few with front-facing speakers. I probably said this when talking about just about every device with this, but it really should be standard, especially in tablets where you have all this space to work with. I mean this isn't even a premium price tablet: it's pretty mid-range and these speaker drivers really aren't even that good, but there's still miles better sounding than anything else with back facing speakers, and you got to love that for media and of course you can see inside That left speaker grill is the front-facing camera. It has a 5 megapixel front facing camera and a 5 megapixel rear facing camera, both of which are actually pretty good quality, but I don't think you should be using them much anyway. So really, my only complaint well with the shield hardware is just the buttons. The power and volume buttons they're, pretty awful, they're, really stiff and have almost zero travel, so they're a pain to use and I've been using this tablet for weeks, and I still can't even change the volume without picking up the tablet and looking at it. So the buttons are my only gripe so anyway. This tablet is clearly meant for gaming and I almost feel bad not talking about all these gaming features because they're totally badass there's a wireless controller. There'S dedicated software hub and everything but, like I said, I'm not a gamer and I wouldn't know best about that. So I'm actually going to leave a link or two repla, the like button to videos that do a good job of showcasing these gaming features. But for me this is an Android 4.4 tablet running almost pure stock Android with a few Nvidia improvements, and I really like that. I put the Google experience launcher on here and not only does it feel really familiar and comfortable, but because it's stock Android with no skin and that beastly NVIDIA k1 everything is fast, fluid and smooth, and the k1 really shows off your even when you're just doing Regular multitasking or web browsing - it's not a super high resolution display so you're not pushing a ton of pixels. It'S a 1080p eight inch display. So it's pretty sharp. But again the panel is just mid-range. It'S a little on the warm side. It'S just it's really about showing off the Nvidia k1 and it's just killing it and just to make sure it wasn't just me giving stock Android too much credit. I fired up an application that honestly on any other Android tablet, lags and stutters and drop streams like crazy and that's Google Earth a very old app, but you've probably experienced yourself. I opened it up here on the shield tablet and the k1 handled it like a boss. Almost zero dropped frames. Beautiful fluid movement might actually finally be the first Android tablet that I can showcase this app on and it doesn't lag and stutter and crash. So I guess it's kind of crazy that Google, or has remained a benchmark for so long so yeah with this awesome graphical performance since Nvidia is doing such a good job with that, of course, using a tablet with general everyday use is very smooth. You get fast performance, it's kind of kind of what you look for when you're buying a tablet, and this basically nails it. Now there are a few additions and Vidya has thrown in again, mostly for gaming, but some of the stuff is pretty cool. One of them - and I guess this is the most major - is the stylus. Yes, they added a stylus to the back of this tablet, something you won't find on a nexus, but it is a pretty advanced stylus. So when you remove it, you get a couple of stylus ready, apps you can choose to launch and the really impressive one here is an Nvidia dabbler. It'S made just for the shield. I guess Nvidia just made this for this new device and it uses and recognizes the shape of the stylus. It'S like a felt-tip pen and it kind of rocks. It'S awesome. It has this really detailed, precise watercolor effect. If you choose to use that brush a whole bunch of different brush effects, I mean I felt like I can mess with this thing all day until I legitimately create works of art like this. Alright, I'm kidding that one came pre-loaded, but this stylus recognition is definitely advanced as anything you'll find on any you know iPad or any other tablet. Okay, another thing NVIDIA has added to the stock. Android experience was some performance modes and I really couldn't even tell the difference. I didn't look behind the scenes at what it was doing to the CPU, but again the main purpose to show off to the NVIDIA k1. So they added those modes to be able to change how that throttles. They also added HDMI settings since there's a mini, HDMI, port and, of course, settings for any controller. You might have added, but again probably an videos dedicated shield wireless controller for gaming, because all these features are for gaming and all the stuff is built right into Android settings. So very conveniently, tucked away where you know you can find them when you want to look for them. There'S also in the quick settings, a toggle for full screen mode, which is basically Android. 4.4 is immersion mode, but full-time for the entire operating system like on demand. So I guess, if you just hate seeing the notifications or you just need a force, the full screen game to happen. You can do that so yeah. Really, this tablet is full-featured. It'S packed. It'S legit! I'Ve enjoyed using it over the Nexus 7, mostly for the front-facing speakers, because again I love hearing a sound to move across your face as the image moves across the screen that kind of stuff you just can't get with rear-facing speakers and it makes media so much Better and tablets are really all about media if you're gaming or watching a video or whatever you're doing, and you know if you're going to look for the software updates over in Nexus. I have faith because the Nvidia shield, the og shield, actually got quite a few updates on the software department. So that's a good sign for this new tablet. I think they'll also get a few software updates, maybe see Android L soon. You know what those rumors of an 8-inch volantis Nexus tablet with front-facing speakers. We'Ve all been dreaming about. You know, even if that doesn't happen, this will always be an option, and it's a pretty good one. Props Nvidia keep it up thanks for watching guys and I'll talk to you in the next one. Peace """
9HtGhNUtW-E,Sony RX100 MKIII Review!,7:13,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm cabby HD here - and this is the Sony rx100 Mark 3 and it's the best pocket camera ever made now. If that sounds familiar, it's because I said the same thing about the rx100 mark: 2: hey. What is up guys, I'm KB HD here - and this is the best pocket camera ever made thanks for watching. So what makes this new camera better than the mark? 2. Well, they've added a couple of features: they've made a few improvements here and they're added a couple of things that make it naturally a little bit of a step up. Obviously, it costs a little bit more I'll have a link in the description. If you want to check this out, but basically it still fits in my pocket and it's better than the mark 2. Therefore, it keeps the title of best camera that I can fit in my pocket. So what are the improvements that make it better than the mark? 2, so number one new viewfinder number two, the LCD and number three, this new lens, so the EVF, the electronic viewfinder, is a new addition. It pops out of the top left side of the camera when you want to use it and it shows all the same controls and the same information as the LCD would so, if you're shooting, outside or in a really bright environment. Where you can't quite see that already gorgeous LCD, you can use that eyepiece and actually has a proximity sensor to turn on and off when you bring your eye up to it. So it's really impressive. It looks good. I don't even know how Sony found the space inside the camera to krema sting in the first place, but they did and it's not any bigger than the last camera. So one thing to really keep an eye on is that EVF? Now the only thing I don't like about it is when I push the viewfinder back in the camera to stop using it, it turns the whole camera off I kind of wish they wouldn't do that. I wish they would. Let me continue using the camera after I'm done using a viewfinder. I guess I should just spend an option in the settings. Alright number two is the LCD. The rx100 mark one had a fixed LCD on the back, couldn't articulate it at all. The mark two had an LCD that you could start to articulate a little bit and move it around. This mark three has an LCD that can flip completely around. So you can see yourself for portrait, photos and videos, I'm being nice, I mean selfies and you can take photos or videos and all kinds of weird angles, thanks to the display being able to flip around more than ever before and last. The third new thing is the new lens, so this camera has always had a great answer that 20 megapixels sensor from Sony, but this mark 3 has a slightly wider angle, slightly faster lens, still super high quality Carl Zeiss glass. So that's awesome, but now it's the equivalent of a 24 to 70 millimeter lens that goes from F, 2.8 at 70 millimetres to F 1.8 at 24 millimeter. So it's a little bit less reach. You don't get quite the same zoom as the mark 2, but that is an insanely low aperture for such a wide angle and it bests anything. Sony has ever done in the past for both on paper and in practice. All this new stuff has the new rx100. Looking a bit like a beast of a camera which it really is kind of like a Swiss Army knife of pocket imagery and everything else, though, is really the same, which is good because it's got that same great battery life. Same great, build quality, same great materials, same great image, quality, dynamic range, sharpness, color same great, easy to understand, Sony menu system and interface same great ring around the front which can be programmed to change the aperture or whatever else you want to change. It can be changed focus, but that ring is actually pretty genius and I'm surprised, no one else has done it yet same great pop-up flash that you can articulate any way you want. So you don't have to flash directly on your subject. You can instead bounce the light off of a wall or ceiling for a softer fill effect same great NFC on the side as the mark 2. So you can install that Sony, PlayMemories app on your phone and if you have your phone with NFC, you can just tap your phone to the camera. To transfer your photos, you just took it's really handy. If you just want to share a quick photo, you took on social media and the photos and videos that it does take are still awesome. The autofocus is super fast, so you don't have to worry about that. It will nail focus every time and then the photos are consistently really sharp with you know. Nice dynamic range, pretty pleasing color reproduction, just like its older brothers. It'S also a killer in low-light, since the sensor is closer to a DSLR size, it's much bigger than other pocket cameras and, honestly, the photos you'll get out of this are very similar to what you get out of something like the Canon, t5i or similarly priced DSLR, And it's kit lens, maybe even better since you get this nice new Sony lens in this Carl Zeiss glass. Now this camera will also be awesome if you're a vlogger. Now, I'm not a vlogger, but if you happen to shoot a lot of front-facing, video or selfie portrait style, video, the wider angle lens and the articulating LCD that lets you see yourself is a huge plus. So that's something you're not going to get on the mark. 1 and mark 2, so this combined with the awesome quality video, like I said, the wider angle lens the faster aperture, the sharpness, the great codec, the dynamic range and everything I mean: it's, not the lightest camera in the world. But if you want to have the highest quality vlogs in the business, I think this is easy choice. Now, as much of the video side that I like to focus on, I do take a lot of photos with this camera and put I post them all over social media, Instagram, Twitter, Google, even Facebook, sometimes and pretty much every time. There'S someone asking hey! That'S a pretty sharp photo. What did you take that with and a lot of times it's what this there's usually a certain character to the photos you take with a pocket camera they're, usually a lower resolution, they're, usually a little bit noisier. I'D have smaller sensors. They don't do as well in low light. Colors might not be quite as good as a more expensive DSLR, but at the end of the day, when you're, comparing a pocket camera to DSLRs instead of other pocket cameras, that's how you can tell that it's the best pocket camera in the world. It'S just that! Much better than all the rest of the smaller cameras out there. No one get me wrong. There are other small cameras that don't fit in my pocket that take really good photos. I'Ve been playing with the Fuji x100s. Recently it's not going to fit in my pocket. It'S smaller than the SLR and it takes DSLR like images so they're, it's really really good, but it doesn't fit in my pocket and that's why it doesn't get the same price. This could even make a great starting youtuber camera if you're, just starting a YouTube, channel and you're looking to buy a camera. That'S going to take awesome videos, it has autofocus, it has great zoom, it has great sharpness, it's not 4k, it's still 1080p video, but it has a great codec. It has a 60 frames per second video 30 frames per second video 24 frames per second video. 720P. 120 frames per second video, it's loaded with features, and, I would actually say, go grab mark 2 or Mark 3 to start a YouTube channel instead of a DSLR and you'll learn a lot about still the kind of shooting we'll do later down the road. If you switch to a DSLR, but there are so many features here that remind me of a DSLR, so I'm going on about it enough. This is obviously one of my thing cameras and I do take it with me all over the place. I'Ll have a link below if you want to check it out. I'Ll also have a link to the mark 2 and the mark 1, like I said, because those tend to be lower priced than the mark 3, but hey. This could be your steal on Black Friday or something like that. This could easily be an awesome gift or something you want to check out like I said, if you're starting a channel or something so the links are below. Thank you for watching hope you enjoyed and if you did feel free to leave a thumbs up below and I'll talk to you guys in the next video peace. """
7QH1qFd24bY,LG G3 Review!,10:21,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm Kay PhD here - and this is the newest Android flagship phone from LG - it's the g3. So it's the successor to the LG g2, which was really nice, but it had its flaws, and this new phone here is out to compete with the galaxy s5 and the HTC One and others. So what does it bring? Well, first of all, I've done two previous videos on this phone, one right before it actually came out. It was actually an exclusive video and mkbhd first hands-on with this new phone before you saw it anywhere else, and my impressions were pretty positive and then a second video all about its display, because if you haven't already heard this phone's display matches the highest resolution ever In any phone at 2560 by 1440 or more than 530 pixels per inch, so really what we're out here to find out is, if packing all those pixels has a negative effect on two of the most important things to consider in a new smartphone the battery life And the performance I'll get into that very shortly, but really we've already seen that this is a very handsome phone. That'S the first thing that struck me about. It is plastic, yes, but with this brush metal looking finish, it kind of fakes, a metal look, but it keeps the phone much lighter by using plastic, and it has a curved back that fits in your hand pretty nicely. So I actually like the way it feels in the hand and because of this back button placement, you actually get to hold the phone just a little bit differently than other phones that put the buttons on the side on the top, and it's actually super quick and Easy to get used to, it seems weird at first, but it's actually really intuitive after just a couple of hours of using the phone, and the back buttons here are also shortcuts. When the screen is asleep so holding the volume button up will quickly open your Notes. App or holding the volume button down will quickly open your camera, app from asleep would have been even nicer if I could change these shortcuts, though, because I never really use LG's Notes app, but they're there. So button placement keeps the phone profile thin, keeps the bezels really thin and sexy it's still a big phone, though don't get me wrong. It is compact for a phone of its size. It'S a big 5.5 inch display, but with the thin bezels, but still most high-end phones have a 5 inch or 5.1 inch display. So this is still going to be a very big phone for a lot of people, so the display you can watch my original video about its sharpness and resolution and you'll basically see that it's insanely sharp it's significantly sharper than a 1080p display or even an iPhone With its sub 720p display - and it does look pretty great, even if the colors are a little bit off, the contrast ratio is not so great. The white balance is questionable. You know a lot of the other aspects of the display. Aren'T really all that great. It looks a little bit pink or a little bit warm to me when compared to an HTC One, but overall, really anything that can take advantage of this. This sharpness is a couple of years out. I mean that isn't much right now. You know the resolution is not going to make a huge difference now, because apps and games and wallpapers don't take advantage of it yet. But I would expect to see a lot more quad HD phone start to come out in the second half of this year and next year and then we'll start to see a lot more apps that will take advantage of the sharpness. But right now it's just kind of a spec line to get you to look at the phone and pay attention to it, but it's a good-looking phone anyway and I really get this this idea. I had this idea to go out and ask people if they could tell the difference between this LG g3 s display and maybe another 5.5 inch display and another phone, that's 1080p. But I have a feeling. A lot of people would like the g3 anyway, just because of how thin the bezels look. It just looks better than a lot of other phones. I mean you could have given me a 1080p display here with this thin of a bezel, and I'd probably still be just as happy with it, and it all comes down to the fact that this phone's design happens to be well just really attractive around the back. You have this removable back, so you reveal here a 3000 milliamp hour battery and a micro SD card slot. For those of you who want to expand storage and with battery life, I was again impressed. It was actually excellent, so there was obviously concerns about whether or not this display would have an impact on battery life, pushing all those pixels taking a hit on the graphics. But as far as I can tell, no, my usage was always pretty moderate to heavy and for the first few days the battery life was decent, but then it got better, especially the standby time I feel like you could go to sleep with 100 % battery and Wake up with 99 % and he'd be great, and now it lasts just as long on a charge as the One m8 that I was raving about. I had a road trip the other day where I got four and a half hours of screen on time, which is more than I've got with plenty of other 1080p phones. So I really like the battery life on this one, plus the fact that it's removable, that's a big bonus for a lot of people now the camera. It'S sporting also has some pretty unique features too. So the software that LG threw in here, it's really really simple. They'Re going after a really simplified UI, no real fine-tuning controls you're not going to get any manual modes in here, but it is outfitted with some neat modes where you can change. Obviously the resolution and you can change the size of the videos you're taking up to 4k. You can turn stabilization on and off, but you also have this magic focus mode. You have a fist gesture selfie which lets you just make a fist and then open it and it'll start the countdown timer. So you don't actually have to touch your phone to take a selfie. I know it's it's a selfie feature but whatever and then you have laser autofocus and that is really really great, so laser autofocus on the back of this phone, you might have been wondering what that last little port. Does it actually fires a laser at the thing you're taking a picture of, and then reflects it back and is able to tell exactly how far away the subject is, focus the camera and take the picture and that all happens extremely quickly, and so I'm really a Big fan of laser autofocus, it does really well with landscapes. It does really well with up-close subjects and macro stuff and it's one of the fastest focusing cameras. I'Ve used in a smartphone so props to LG. For that now. Another thing that we were talking about was the performance of this phone, and again I found that it's been pretty good if you check it out versus another high-end phone, with a 1080p display like the HTC One m8 or the Galaxy s5, or something like that. It holds up pretty much exactly the same. The only tiny little thing I found, which is kind of ironic because I saw it in another phone - is a little bit of a delay with the soft buttons, but a lot of these little minor things can be fixed with a software update. There were concerns about the graphics being taking a hit because of all these pixels, I would say I don't see anything. The gaming is exactly the same. The opening and closing apps is exactly the same. The scrolling, the frame rates - everything still looks great, so this is, of course, the LG scan on top of android 4.4 kitkat, and it seems to perform really well and the design is okay. Now, a lot of people are really gushing over this design. I just think it's, okay, it's definitely better than the skin. That was in the lg g2. So I appreciate that improvement, but I'm of course you know how I feel about Android skins. Already there are a couple of things I would like to see changed. You can only really see maybe two sometimes three notifications at once before you have to scroll just because of how much stuff is going on in the notification bar the Settings. App is still pretty ugly and I think awful to navigate. It'S been a while, since the skin phone did settings well - and I think most smartphones could really use it overall to the Settings app and the multitasking it's smart. It makes a lot of sense, the pinch-to-zoom to be able to see more or less apps. At the same time as smart, but is this really how you wanted it to look? I'M not sure that I really like the way it appears, but there's also plenty of other interesting great stuff about this LG skin. One thing I love the LG keyboard is really nice. If you go into the keyboard settings, you can pick exactly how tall it is when I first got the phone out the box, the keyboard was actually too small for me, despite it having a big display, but I had big hands. I made the screen and the keyboard bigger, and now I love that it has been the number pad available all the time. It'S great. I also love that the enhanced clipboard feature is so smart. I think every phone should adopt something like this. It remembers multiple things that you can copy multiple, screenshots, multiple things that you want to paste and whenever you hold down to start to try to pay something it'll ask you which thing you want to paste. It'S very very useful. Also LG has a couple of these notices. These smart cards, which I thought were pretty funny. I don't know why I found them so funny that you could just go to Google now for the weather, but it always felt the need to give me a long sentence about how the day was going to go. So that was nice and there's plenty of other features that LG's worked on. There'S the dual window for multitasking: there's a knock code for unlocking your phone. I stopped using it, but it is pretty neat so tons of stuff like that. The 1 amp speaker on the back of this phone. It'S supposed to be amplified it's supposed to be special. It'S not special. I mean it's kind of loud a little bit, but it's really kind of just like any other back facing speaker phone. I also wish the notification LED was a little bigger just because I've been messing with a lot of phones recently that it's way brighter on, but overall really you got to admit. The g3 is a complete package. There are a lot of great things about this phone. If you're coming from a g2 you're going to like a lot of the improvements, especially in the software department - and you just can't say no to that display when you're future-proof, like that, the one weird thing that I found was it tends to heat up a little Bit I have screenshots of times where it would tell me I can't brighten the phone anymore, because if I do it'll overheat - and it basically doesn't want me to so it's trying to cool the phone down by limiting how bright I can make the display and one Time I was navigating in Google Maps and it actually threatened to basically say it's going to turn off soon. If you don't cool this phone down, so sometimes it does heat up a little bit more than other phones. I'Ve used. I haven't gotten that notice on other phones, but other than that I got to love it so bottom line is. I am really a fan of what I'm seeing on the lg g3 and I really like it now. If you'd asked me what I thought, the best phones of 2014 would be at the beginning of this year. I might have left the LG g3 off the list, just because I wasn't a huge fan of the g2. I wasn't a fan of LG skin, not as much as some other people anyway. So I probably would have gone straight to the Galaxy series and the note series and the HTC One, but now that this is out and now that we know everything we know about it, it's clearly easily one of the best phones. That'S come out this year. If not the best, especially because of the display, so again, let me know what you guys think of this LG g3. That'S been it for this full video review. Thank you for watching and if you have any other questions or comments about, it feel free to drop. Those in the comments section below so I can answer them and talk to you guys again, thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one bass you """
yAyR_YHEZ_c,LG G3 QHD Display Review!,5:53,"Hey, what is up guys? I'M kV HD here, and this is the LG g3 and it has a quad HD display, which means it's rocking a 2560 by 1440 resolution, if your mind isn't blown yet, let me give you some perspective. Let me take you back. A few years to the iPhone 3GS, this was Apple's flagship in 2009 and it had a three-and-a-half inch display at a resolution of 320 by 480, giving it a pixel density of 165 pixels per inch and it looked pretty good. It looked decently, sharp and Apple thought. It was good, but the next year Apple released the iPhone 4 and one of its biggest named features which took its name dropped. All the time now is the retina display. It'S the highest resolution display ever built into a phone at 326 pixels per inch. You get four times the pixels as before, so instead of the fuzziness of individual pixels, you get smooth, continuous shapes and tone. You have something that looks to your eye like you're, holding a printed page in your hand and the level of fine detail, and images is just incredible, so the iPhone 4 they are talking about still has a three-and-a-half inch display. But now has a resolution of 640 by 960, which gives it a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch. So at that point figure, that's the size. We'Re going to go right like that's as much as we need anything north of 300. Pixels per inch is so sharp that you literally cannot see fuzzyness. You cannot discern individual pixels on the display at a normal viewing distance or even at a super close viewing distance. But no, of course we didn't stop there. We'Ve since then, gotten 1280 by 720 displays 1920 by 1080 displays and now panels 2560 by 1440 in a smart phone. Obviously it's much bigger. It'S a 5.5 inch screen now, but the sharpness at over 500 PPI is crazy. But if everything north of 300 pixels per inch is the same, then why even bother with quad HD? Why would you I mean? Surely it's going to hit battery life right? It'S going to stress your graphics extra. It might kind of disturb the performance of the phone. Well, I hope to find out exactly how much this phone's display affects its performance in the full review, so make sure you subscribe to the channel if you haven't already to see that full review when it comes out that button is below somewhere it's red, but until Then this video just going to be taking a look at the quality difference to see if there's really difference between this quad HD display and some others so go ahead and use the gear in the bottom right hand corner of the video to change this to 4k Or 1440p or whatever highest resolution, you can watch it in and fullscreen it, because even if you don't have a 4k display YouTube streams, these high resolution videos at higher bit rates, so the clarity is improved anyway. So here is the new OS. 10 Yosemite 5k wallpaper. It'S a really high resolution higher than any other display I have, and here is that wallpaper on the iPhone 5s. So it's a 4-inch display at 326 pixels per inch and you can see it looks pretty good, it's pretty crisp and from a regular viewing distance. There are absolutely no problems and, like we said, Apple has boasted about this 326 pixels per inch a lot and that's what they call a Retina display. So now here it is on the HTC One m8. This is a much larger 5-inch display coming in at 1920. By 1080, which gives it a pixel density of 441 pixels per inch and it seems like a noticeable improvement actually which most would say, you know it's crystal clear. You know not a pixel in sight a little bit better and probably more enjoyable of a viewing experience because of the larger display. But again this is 441 pixels per inch. And lastly, here it is on the lg g3, which, like we've said, is a new 5.5 inch. Quad HD display coming in at 534 pixels per inch and I mean come on: that's ridiculously sharp and whether or not you can see it though technically yes, there is actually a difference in clarity only because we're using an image here. That'S of a high enough resolution. Here'S another super high-res image on all three displays and I got to say, while they all look great, you really couldn't tell the difference unless you're holding them side-by-side or comparing them. Of course, there are other things that make a good display, like color accuracy and viewing angles, and obviously the size of the panel that does elapsed around it and there's a ton of stuff like goes into making a good smartphone display. But really the bottom line here is that it's actually kind of hard to tell the difference between quad HD and even 1080p, unless you're looking for the difference or holding them up side-by-side like we have in this 4k video and since every app on your phone is Basically, scaled to 1080p right now, you're not going to notice much of the benefits or advantages of having the super high res display. For now I mean text will definitely be sharper and wallpapers will look awesome and all of LG's assets like I've said their icons are great, but third party stuff, I mean their icons, still aren't super high resolution and apps don't really take advantage of all those extra Pixels, yet the YouTube app on Android still only streams at a highest quality of 720p, not even 1080p. So really the benefits are limited but, like I said that's for now, it makes a much bigger difference on bigger panels like computer monitors and TVs to have that higher resolution. But that doesn't mean I don't appreciate a baller display in a smartphone and while it's not necessarily worth it now, it sure will be in maybe one or two years when every smartphone is quite HD. So there you go. That'S what it looks like to have the quad HD display on the LG g3 again, the full review of this phone is in the works, as I put it through its paces. So that's coming soon enough and I can't wait to show you guys, the other stuff. I'M working on too so thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one bass. """
FrgGHAab9D8,OnePlus One Review!,12:10,"Hey what is up guys, I'm KB HD here - and this is the oneplus one, it's a new phone from a new manufacturer and it's gotten a lot of attention. It'S actually one of the most polarizing phones I have ever seen so over in the tech community. This phone is almost impossible to get. People are swarming over this phone. There is way more demand and supply. There'S an invite system. It'S just really really hard to get your hands on, but then I go over to class and so on says hey what phone is that, and I say it's the oneplus one and they go the what I don't. I don't really know what that is. So clearly. There'S a big divide over who cares about this phone? Why? The short answer to that question is the price: this phone, when it's available, will cost outright $ 300 for the phone off contract for perspective. The iPhone 5s will retail $ 700, which off-contract the galaxy s5 $ 700 off contract, the HTC one $ 700 off contract. So when you put up a phone with very similar specs to that and it costs only $ 250 off contract, its turn a lot of heads in the tech community and that's because we care about specs. So, let's try to find out if this worth caring about the specs for this low of a price, so just to get it out the way it is rockin at 2.5 gigahertz quad-core, Snapdragon, 801 chip, the audrina 330 GPU 3 gigabytes of ram a 13 megapixel camera. A 30 100 million power battery all very similar specs to something like the samsung galaxy s5 and on top of all that, for a premium slab style phone, the oneplus one is built, really well, actually think it's design as one of its best assets. So this white version here is extremely soft to the touch and they advertise that a lot. It'S super soft and yet it's also very durable. It feels really solid on the hand, thanks to all the metal involved around the frame, so all the way around the phone. No matter how you hold it, you're touching metal somewhere, and it really does actually have the perfect button placement for a big phone. Yes, it's big. It'S that 5.5 inch 1080p display, but the power button is low enough on that right-hand side and the volume buttons are low enough that it shows up actually took some notes. I actually thought about where to put these buds and it keeps the phone pretty usable to even someone with smaller hands more comparable to the smaller five inch or 5.1 inch display flagships. It'S also pretty thin. So really the design is one of the best points about the oneplus one. So with the beastly specs and pretty top-notch build quality, it seems like you're, getting a lot for your money for this phone and it certainly feels like it when you're holding it again. It feels like a beast of a phone. You also have LTE 802 dot. Eleven AC Wi-Fi a big battery, like I said, 3100 milliamp hours, but it's not removable, although you can take off the back and soon you'll be able to replace the back with other covers of different materials, and I also notice that this phone has three microphones one On top one on the back and one on the bottom leading me to believe, the audio quality would be great and it was and calls, but for some reason the call volume of the person I was talking to was super low. Like I crank the volume - and I could barely hear who I was talking to - which was weird - but I guess that can be fixed with a software update but for other apps, the speaker sounded just fine, maybe even a bit above average, since it's real stereo. Instead of fake stereo like the iPhone or the Nexus 5, so if you've been looking really hard for a flaw that makes this phone's Hardware worth really less than the other $ 700 flagships, it's trying to kill, you probably haven't found it yet, and neither have I I mean I've been using the phone for weeks. As far as I can tell, this phone is pretty much flawless, a miracle piece of hardware for the price and I've been damn impressed with using it, but really guys. This phone is super similar on the inside to a lot of those others $ 700 phones thanks to the specs inside. So what really differentiates it? What really makes this a different phone is actually the software it's CyanogenMod and, like I said in that top five video I did not too long ago. For all intents and purposes, this is a CyanogenMod phone. This is going to depend on the features and the awesome stuff that comes with CyanogenMod 11s. So it's a custom built OS for this phone based on the latest version of Android 4.4 KitKat, and it's definitely filled with extra features specifically for this hardware, which is nice to see, I've talked about some of their stuff before so it lets. You choose a lot of things to really customize your vanilla, Android like experience, so you can really make it your own. You can make. It seem very much like a nexus almost stock like me, or you can hop in the theme manager and really go crazy. All-Out customizing, not just a wallpaper and your icons, but your boot animation and your lockscreen and everything all sorts of stuff - and there are custom, features like being able to choose between on-screen software buttons or off-screen capacitive buttons. Depending on what you like. You can't do that on any other phone. You can also customize what the software buttons show up by adding or subtracting or reordering them. However, you like so there's tons of stuff here that you'd probably be used to finding in a custom ROM, because really that's what this is. It'S CyanogenMod, even though this device is not rooted out, the box no sign engine mod feature is, you can say: hey, Snapdragon, hey Snapdragon, hey Snapdragon, hey Snapdragon, and sometimes it decides to wait and work and other times it doesn't and when you do it opens up. Google now and it you have to train your voice for a while and haven't found. This could be really all that responsive, but, like you just saw it does work sometimes they've also custom built a lock screen, so it blurs your wallpaper or since it's Android 4.4, we'll also blur whatever album art of whatever music you're listening to, while it's playing, which Is really cool and I'm actually a pretty big fan of this lockscreen just because it's a big screen and not everyone can reach the center with one finger. So just swiping, down from anywhere in the middle, is pretty convenient. If you're trying to use the device with one hand and of course you can always swipe to get into the camera directly from the lock screen as well and they've custom-built a few other apps like the Audio FX control, which works really well for listening and music, The themes browser again like we mentioned the gallery and the camera app. So this is a custom built one by cyanogen, again, it's kind of a cross between the old Google camera and the new one. But I do like how easy it is to switch between shooting modes. They made it really easy here, just a vertical swipe up or down to move between modes. So I actually found myself using us a lot just to quickly switch to HDR real quick. I used to use it all the time just because of how easy it was, and the camera itself on the phone was surprisingly nice to me, like I've heard some other people didn't really like it that much, but I think it's pretty good, certainly better than the Google Play edition One m8 I'm coming from, so it takes 13 megapixel photos and it's capable of 4k or slow-motion video and I'm actually a fan of how low-profile the physical camera itself is. People don't really talk about it that much, but it reminds me a lot of the Oppo find 7 here, which is probably the phone that this is physically most similar to and it's six out just a tiny little bit, but I say good job to them. On keeping the camera pretty small and low-profile and the actual pictures, it takes look pretty nice, so there's no optical image stabilization, but it does have dual LED flash and multiple lenses and everything else. You'D expect from a nice camera and the photos were detailed and saturated and well colored and sharp. I actually like the action mode because it forces a faster shutter speed which freezes stuff at the expense of a bit of a higher ISO, but it does reduce blur really well. So it almost kind of makes up for that lack of stabilization. Low-Light pictures again were okay compared to other decent phones. I mean this is a solid camera. I mentioned in my fine 7a review that I'm a fan of the slightly over aggressive HDR, and we see it again here almost the exact same way. I mean this one plus one camera is where I was probably fully expecting to be let down by the price tag, but nope gets a thumbs up for me here. So the only real con here in this phone is signage and mods bugs which is good and bad bad, because it's the whole OS and it's a custom OS both for the phone. So you'd expect it to be perfect. Yes, but it's also good because, even though it's not perfect, it can be fixed with software updates. So during my use of this phone I kept coming across little forced closes and little errors that I just don't normally see on other phones and a lot of them were easily reproducible. For example, if you open up the camera app directly from the lockscreen, then hit the kind of invisible home button, your wallpaper will glitch a bit and black out the bottom part and will not fix itself until you sleep the phone and then wake it again, where The bottom part of the wallpaper reappears kind of weird, but happens every time. Little stuff like that regular performance, you know, zipping around the phone and multitasking is just fine opening and closing apps animations frame rates are all high. Even gaming is pretty great. I'Ve played a couple of games on this phone, I'm not a big hammer on my phone, but it's it seems solid, but this is where it really gets. Weird really, almost all of the other animations throughout the OS are fast, except for the home button. Now, of course, I have on-screen buttons, but I tried this with the off-screen buttons too, and I got the same issue. The home button response time is super slow. A lot of you guys mentioned this in the top five video like what is that lag coming from? It'S not really a lag, it's just a palpable delay, a delay between hitting the home button and then actually starting the animation to go home. It'S so big of a delay that a lot of us notice it every time they got annoying for me. So I actually put it up next to the Google Play edition. One m8 like just to make sure I wasn't going crazy and sure enough yeah, it's got some serious delay and I don't know why the other buttons don't have a delay. The back button is actually faster and the multitasking button works just fine, so I thought it was waiting for a home DoubleTap to see if I was sleeping the screen, but I turn that option off. So I really have no explanation for this massive intrusive delay for the home button and I can only hope signage in already knows about this issue and is working to fix it with a quick over-the-air software update. So that's kind of the story of using this phone. I love the hardware and using it in everything. It just doesn't feel quite as polished as a nexus or another high-end flagship when I'm using it and that's evident by the little software problems here and there. The occasional delays and force closes when working around and trying to use all the awesome features of this custom operating system. So, at the end of the day, yeah this phone comes down to CyanogenMod and whether or not signage in can keep improving and keep sending updates to this phone. I'Ve already gotten one in the time I've spent with it and whether or not they can live up to these specs, because I would really expect a phone with such awesome. Specs like this, to perform kind of like a $ 700 phone, I'm not expecting it to match every part of that phone, but I expected a custom OS for a brand new company's phone to to release perform optimally on it. So really, this phone is going to live or die on CyanogenMod and whether or not the updates come and keep it stable like it would on a nexus, because you can already expect that to happen on in Nexus so yeah. This is a really impressive phone. I am, I am really big fan of the hardware I like how soft the back is. I like how sturdy it's built. I like the specs. I like the way it looks. It is a big phone, but I have big hands. I don't mind that, and I can understand why people are clamoring over this phone, especially in a tech community. I don't think you should smash a $ 700 phone to get it, but hey marketing is marketing, and this is a pretty well priced phone for what you're getting for the money. So I say, if you're willing to take that risk inside engine mod and you think they're going to actually maintain it and update it like a nexus, is pretty much guaranteed to be from google and you want that experience for a hundred bucks off. It might just be a damn good deal for the risk of taking. So if you trust them do it it's going to be worth it, I don't have any invites. I can get you an invite if you're trying to get this phone I'll, keep you guys updated on Twitter, of course, in the link right below that like button for availability and things like that, if you're trying to get your hands on it, but for now there Might be a giveaway coming up, maybe soon, but really the idea here is if you're trusting CyanogenMod is a pretty good pick, so there you go guys thanks for watching this review. Video hope you enjoyed it again, there's a thumbs up button below to click. If you liked it - and I will talk to you guys in the next video """
Ew5ZzloH4Mg,HTC One M8 Google Play Edition Review!,5:50,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kay PhD here, and welcome to this quick review of the Google Play edition HTC One m8. Now I always say welcome to this quick video and then ends up being like 9 minutes long. So I think this can actually be a quick video review, because I've already reviewed at the regular HTC One m8 I'll have that link as the first link right below that like button. If you want to check out all the details of that phone in full, so I guess what we can focus on now. Here is the differences between the Google Play edition and the non Google Play edition One m8: let's take a look so on the outside. This Google Play edition is the exact same as the other version. It'S got that same legendary, all-metal, design, same awesome, specs and it's still built like a boss, so no changes there. The only difference is actually the lack of any carrier branding at all on the Google Play edition, where you'll likely find some sort of [ __ ] stamp on all the carrier versions. Here you can see Verizon being the most guilty as usual. So that means all the differences lie in the software to where the Google Play edition. One m8 is running stock, Android, 4.4.2 kitkat and will likely be upgraded to the next version of Android before the regular m8 and likely right behind the Nexus updates. So with this software, that means they're getting essentially the same experience as if you're using a Nexus device, but wait what about all the HTC features that could potentially make it better than a nexus. Only experience well no need to fear your HTC put a bunch of their apps and services here in the Play Store and that's where they can update them and they've made them compatible with the Google Play edition One m8. So, even though you tap into it - and it says it's not compatible - they are installed here and are working perfectly, so this phone will work with the dot view case that got so much attention. It'Ll work with the IR blaster and the top of the phone to control your TV with that app and, most importantly, the Google Play edition. One m8 also takes advantage of that duo camera system on the back. We talked a lot about this in the regular one and make review, but obviously the Google Play edition does not have that same camera app. It'S rocking that new Google camera app in the Play Store for all devices running Android, 4.4 KitKat and above that means it has a different user interface, which is not HTC specific, so you use the fun stuff like you focus and foreground ER and stuff. Well, basically, you take a picture as usual here and then, when you swipe over and hit the edit button on that photo, you'll have an option to pop up. You can do it using the regular google photos, editor or the HTC photo editor, and it's by jumping in here that you can use that beautiful. You focus and foreground ER and all the same effects that you used to with the regular m8 s -- camera. That'S where it hides so there's actually a really neat little effect now built into the google camera. It'S called lens blur, which is not exactly the same thing, but really it lets you get a similar blurred background effect by tilting the phone a bit. Obviously, you focus is a bit easier because you don't have to move the phone while taking the shot, but now you have, I guess, two options on the phone for blurring the background. Only thing that seems to not be working in the camera is the slow-motion video recording and the little warning that's supposed to pop up. If you accidentally cover the depth sensor, which actually did a lot, maybe I have big hands and that's why? But I guess I'm gon na have to adjust the way I grip the phone when taking pictures with it now. Another thing you might recall from the One m8 review is the ability to turn your phone on without touching this power button, with just a double tap or a swipe across the screen. These options are present in the settings here. They are called motion, launch gestures and there's even it's actually simplified here. Really you can just double tap to wake or sleep the screen on the lock screen. You can do the volume button turn to launch the camera or swipe literally in any direction on the off screen to unlock your phone, so it doesn't really matter which direction you swipe. It'S not going to launch any special HTC voice, tiling or anything any swipe in any direction, just unlocks the phone, but other than that this is you know exactly what you would expect out of the m8 with stock Android on it. You know simple, clean, very fast. You use a little bit less of the built-in storage, but you also keep that microSD card expansion that you actually don't get in nexuses. You also use a little bit less of the RAM than you would from HTC Sense and you get an overall really snappy buttery beautiful experience. So you have all the perks and good looks from stock Android that I actually prefer over really any skin, including HTC Sense. 6, so that's really why I've loved using it so much, obviously, Google Play edition stuff is from the Google Play Store only and a US only store, and also it's out of inventory right now as I speak, but when it is in inventory, it's only available in The 32 gig Silver Edition, so no dark, charcoal or gold or any of the fancy colors. Just this exact model is the only one you can get, and it's only in the United States because see Google Play Store. It'S also not available on Verizon. In case you were thinking of putting a Verizon same in it, it won't work it's GSM only so I have my AT """
QahWCPNALDA,Oppo Find 7a Review!,12:27,"Hey what is up guys and que PhD here - and this is the Oppo find 7 a so what Oppo actually did recently was they released two phones. At the same time, the Oppo find 7 and the Oppo find 7 a the 7 being the higher end, basically device that we all expected and the 7 a being a sort of a step down $ 100 cheaper, a sort of a little brother, the 7 isn't Out yet, but this 7, a is probably the best look, we're going to get obviously at what to expect with the find 7. So without any more confusion between the two names, let's go ahead and take a closer look at the fine 7a. The little brother and see what makes it so special, so the design of this 7a is going to be exactly the same as the fine 7. And I really like the way this phone looks and feels in the hand I actually didn't at first. But it really grew on me and I'm a fan of it now now don't get me wrong, it's a big phone. You got to realize it has a 5.5 inch 1080p display and the fine 7 will have a 5.5 inch 2560 by 1440 display. So you can see next to the galaxy s5 here, which has a 5.1 inch display that it looks rather large. It'S a lot bigger in the hand and there's a lot of phone going on here. No doubt even next to the notoriously big Galaxy Note: 3. You'Re still looking at a slightly taller phone on the Oppo side, so you're definitely looking at a big phone. But to tell you the truth, I really didn't notice like, even if you didn't hold the other phones, you wouldn't really think that this is a massive phone. It done a great job, keeping the bezels slim and a really trim handsome profile, so the phone doesn't actually feel like a 5.5 inch phone really the main way. You know that it's solid and well-built is its weight. It'S 170 grams versus the all-metal 1m 860, and it reminds me of that fine 5 from earlier. Actually, when the build materials are so dense, like this, the whole glass front, the metal frame all around the sides just the way the phone feels it screams quality again reminds me exactly the define 5. So I really do like the phone's design. Like I mentioned, it is quite thin for its size. It'S got a pretty big battery, but it's still pretty light and despite the fact that it's a smooth back material, it's still pretty easy to hold. It'S not slippery, like the HTC. One was because you have those edges of the phone's to hold its its square instead of round and another awesome point about design. The button placement is perfect. You have the power button right where your hand falls nicely on the phone. If you holding your right hand, you can press the power button, you can press the volume keys, that's really nice, but actually what I think it's one of the coolest parts of the design of this phone is in the chin of it right behind the chin. It'S what Apple calls the skyline notification light. So there's this big blue glowing LED notification, light behind the chin bar of this phone. It looks really nice thing is. It is only blue, so obviously it's a notification light, so it would be nice to have like red and yellow and green and different colors to represent different things, but it is pretty cool. It looks beautiful when you're charging, when you get a new notification, it pulses for your vibrantly and it looks really cool along the width of the phone, so that's nice and if the fine 7 doesn't have it at least, I think the next version Oppo. You should have a multicolor LED, because that would be super duper useful for a lot of people. So this one is rocking Android 4.3, with a pose color OS on top and we've seen color OS on their other phones like the Oppo n1 and the Oppo find 5. So we expected it again here on the fine 7. It'S got a lot of improvements. It'S got a lot of interesting, nifty, pro's and con's. Some cool features that really make it a unique experience. It'S really like no other smartphone skin experience, and I like a lot of it, so one big problem. Everyone seems to have with one skin or another, whether its TouchWiz or HTC Sense or Sony skin or whatever is just the way it looks aesthetics. Sometimes things just don't look the way you want them to, and I got to be honest out of the box. I really didn't like the way color OS looks, but what's nice is they have a built-in themer a whole store of free themes to change the look of your launcher in your homescreen. So I actually have this jellybean theme going on here. So you can see all of my icons and the whole launcher resembles the experience of stock Android so pretty similar to Nexus. Now this doesn't change the look of inside the applications. Obviously, the notification bar inside all the stock apps. They still look like color OS, but it definitely changes the feel of the OS just by refreshing, the launcher. It just feels different, I'm staying with the lockscreen. Actually, the only reason I have this sick lockscreen here is because I found it in the lockscreen themer, which does the exact same thing, so he can choose different, lock, screens, download them locally, store them and basically switch between them. Whenever you, you can totally change the look of your lockscreen and there are a lot of them. It'S a pretty robust store, so color me impressed there and yeah color OS has a bunch of other things going for it. One is there's no on-screen buttons on this phone, so you have these very faint menu home and back buttons that color OS works with. So remember how on the HTC One m8, you can double tap to turn the screen on, but you still need the power button to turn it off. So Oppo has done this same thing where you can double tap to wake, but now you can double tap that home button to sleep the display as well. So in theory, you now really never have to touch the power button at all. So that's nice! You also have some really nice widgets. Some of these go really fullscreen and hide the notification bar they're super immersive. We first saw these on the Oppo find 5 and the selection keeps growing, and these things keep evolving every time I see them. So that's cool and of course you have access to a ton of awesome wallpapers and you can even change the homescreen swiping effect right from that long press menu, so lots of nice stuff going on here lots of shortcuts and I guess one of the most significant Shortcuts is gestures so, when you swipe down from the right hand, side anywhere on this phone you'll get that regular notification shade. Of course, your quick settings, your brightness toggle, your notifications, etc. But when you swipe down from the left corner down, comes your oh, so colourful gesture panel. So it comes programmed with a pair of gestures already, but you can basically add anything you want. You can draw any shape with your finger and have it map to launch any application or call any contact or whatever you want a by default. Drawing a circle will launch the camera from wherever you are and speaking of the camera, this phone has an excellent camera. I don't want to say it surprised me, but I really didn't expect it to be this nice of a camera and that's coming from someone like me: who's used the Sony, Xperia z1, iPhone, 5s galaxy, s5, etc. So, first of all the user interface, it's nice. It'S very clean, simple, intuitive and that's pretty important too a nice camera experience. Your Settings button on the bottom left gets you access to all your normal features like changing the photo resolution up to the max 13 megapixels or maxing out the 4k video recording capability, and this camera will even shoot RAW images and it has a number of other Modes, but what's really interesting, is the one button called HD picture which is going to be renamed in a software update to be called Ultra HD. This is being touted as the button that will give you 50 megapixel pictures, though it's some software stitching tricks involved. So, of course, I turned it on and I tried it and it kind of works kinda. So here's the thing. So this is what an image looks like taken at the normal 13 megapixels right. The image here is 41 60 by 30 120. It'S even got some HDR going on, so it's very detailed throughout, and this is what the crop looks like of that skyline. So when I really get in close to that freedom tower, that's what it looks like okay. So then I press the magic button and take another picture again this time with Ultra HD on so now. The resolution is way bigger, it's 81, 60 by 60 120 and for the record. Yes, that is 50 mega pixels and the overall picture you can see, looks a little flatter, but what happens when I crop here? Well, it's definitely got a lot of detail. It looks a bit sharper but side-by-side. It'S obviously not looking quite as sharp as an actual 50 megapixel camera would, but really you wouldn't expect it to it's a phone here. Basically, what I'm saying here is it's a law of diminishing returns. This particular feature leaving this mode on it'll, do as best as it can, with software stitching, to get as much detail out of the image as it can, and it does take an extra second or two of processing to composite this stuff. So you might as well leave it on for taking pictures of still subjects, but it doesn't look much better than say a panorama photo from the galaxy s5, which can easily blow up to like 20 megapixels by itself. I'Ve done it. So what I'm trying to say here is don't think of this as the 50 megapixel photo mode. Just think of this as the enhanced detail mode for still subjects just like HDR mode is an enhanced dynamic range mode for still subjects and for moving subjects. This camera is plenty fast anyway. The shutter is damn near instant. I was very confident taking photos with this camera and the detail and regular shots is pretty solid to begin with, and I'm a fan of the pretty aggressive HDR processing in that mode on this camera. So you know what I'm a fan: I'm a fan of the camera on the 7a and I'm assuming that will carry over to the Big Brother, find seven that's available, so the Oppo find 7 a actually has a slightly smaller battery than the fine 7. It has a twenty eight hundred million power removable battery, but here's what's badass about this - you might have heard about it. It'S got this really really fast charging technology. It'S really not all that new technology. It just has a beast of a charger. So there's a special white charging, brick that comes with this phone and it's a little intimidating at first, but essentially you'll notice that if you look at like your normal phone charger, it's usually one amp, maybe one and a half amps. And if you look at a tablet, charger that usually comes in at two, maybe two and a half amps this one we're looking at here is a four and a half amp charger. It'S going to throw way more current through the battery and that will in turn charge it way faster. So you have to use this exact model that comes in the phone box. If you want to get that super fast charging, I kind of wish I could use a different one or maybe a longer cable because out the box. It'S only maybe about a meter, long cable, I kind of wish it was longer more than just three three and a half feet, but really it's all about using this power, brick to charge your phone ridiculously fast. So obviously, with this ridiculously powerful charger, I was able to charge this phone super fast, obviously only with this included charging brick, but I was able to go from 0 % to 13 % in five minutes and if you do the percentage by minute calculation, this thing Is charging really fast, so you can charge your phone really quickly. It'Ll go all the way to 100 % in just a couple minutes, but thing is the battery life? Actually wasn't all that great? You know obviously using the phone a lot, I'm using it heavily when I'm testing it I'm gaming a lot, I'm doing a lot of web browsing a lot of Twitter and I found that, while that kind of usage was normal, that that was all fine, the standby Time was really weak compared to some other phones. I'Ve used. I just came off testing the Oppo, the HTC One m8 that had a fantastic standby time. You could forget to charge it overnight and would have almost the same amount of battery when you wake up. Not so with this phone, this phone is going to drop 10 to 15 % overnight. I could attribute that to the color OS the ROM they have on this phone. It could just be some software tweaks. They need to work out some stuff running in the background, but for now I think they need to work on the standby time and hopefully, it'll be able to last as long as other phones with a 2,800 milliamp hour battery. So, overall, you know what I'm impressed with the 7a a big beautiful screen in a nice design and a phone like this and a well-constructed package. I really like that. Obviously, color OS will have plenty of software updates and they're constantly working on that we've seen Oppo push updates they've already pushed an update during the time. I'Ve been testing the phone. So this gives you a pretty good idea of how beastly the fine 7 is going to be when that comes out with a 2.5 k display with the 2.5 gigahertz quad-core processor, with three gigs of ram 3000 milliamp hour battery, that's going to be an even more Awesome experience, but for now this phone is pretty solid and if you don't want to spend the extra hundred bucks, this is a pretty sweet option to consider. I like to find five. I really like to find seven a can't wait to check out find seven.

z8gOX35dAfc,Samsung Galaxy S5 Review!,11:49,"Hey what is up guys on kb HD here - and this is the samsung galaxy s5, so right off the bat we can see. This phone looks really similar to the galaxy s4 from last year and as upgraded specs inside, of course, which are virtually identical to the one m8, except for one or two things. But it keeps a very similar design to the galaxy s4, though it is a little bit bigger now to fit that 5.1 inch 1080p display and the slightly bigger bezels so awkwardly enough. One of the biggest complaints with the new designs about the backing, which a lot of people aren't a fan of, I mean I called it. I call the gold version of this phone - the band-aid Edition, but basically it has all these little dimples across the back of this soft touch. Material turns out. This is easier to grip and hold in the hand than the slippery metal of the HTC One m8. So while the m8 might be a little bit heavier and made entirely of metal, the s5 is easier to hold because it's lighter and the button placement is much better. You got the power button on the side now, so you don't have to shimmy your hand and it has actual sides to grip, even though those sides are made of Samsung's fake metal. Oh and the back happens to still be removable, so you get not only microSD card expansion up to 128 extra gigabytes, but you also get access to that twenty eight hundred million power battery and something you might notice while taking that back off, is this seal. All the way around the inside of the cover of this phone, this is to make the internals or the whole phone ip67 certified. So ip67, the six means totally protected against dust and the seven means water-resistant for limited periods of time, which is useful to some people. But you'll notice the seal does not go over the speaker, which sounds alright but maxes out pretty low in volume compared to the HTC One. But I guess you know everything is quiet compared to the one. So the full video comparison between the s5 and the one are coming soon, but bottom line is this thing is water-resistant and a lot of people are gon na like that, but also to protect the phone from dust and water. They needed to add. Probably my biggest gripe with the design of the entire phone, this freaking flap at the bottom - that you have to pry off every time you want access to the USB port. Every time you want to charge. That means you can't use any battery cases, because you have to pry that thing out the way, all the time it just gets in the way when you're plugged in and to top it all off. Every time you unplug the phone from the wall. It reminds you to close the flap every single time bottom line, I'm not a fan of the flap, although I guess it is necessary to keep that certification, but other than that. This is really a familiar design for anyone. Who'S used previous Galaxy devices, especially the Galaxy s4 and you'll notice. They'Ve changed the capacitive buttons up front. So now, really the only face change besides the bigger bezels. Is you have that multitasking button and back button? So you can hold down the multitasking button to act as a mini button and right between those capacitive buttons. Is the fingerprint sensor slash home button, I'm basically going to cover everything by saying it's not really that great. First of all, it makes the home button a little bit mushy ER and less clicky than before and second of all, much more importantly, you have to swipe your finger perfectly vertically along the center of the pad for it to work. You don't just put your finger. There you have to swipe it perfectly vertically for it to work. So, yes, you can register a bunch of finger prints and secure your phone or your PayPal payments or whatever you want to do and it'll work. If you take your time with it, but it's difficult to use correctly and it's not always accurate when you don't swipe your finger at just the right speed at the right angle, which does, by the way, require holding the phone with one hand and swiping with the Other, so you need two fingers to unlock your phone, and sometimes I'd actually go to unlock my phone with the fingerprint on and it would work and then I'd unlock it a little bit later and it just wouldn't even work. It doesn't even ask just lets me swipe to unlock and get in without my fingerprint, and that was it so yeah. I turned off the fingerprint recognition stuff before the end of it. The first day I used it really was a pain, but anyway, once you unlock the phone and get in you are greeted with TouchWiz on top of Android 4.4 and it's all right now. It'S definitely not my cup of tea. It'S not my favorite, but I prefer it to previous versions. They definitely made some adjustments and cleaned it up and made changes that I, like. I know, they've shaken that inspired by nature stuff from TouchWiz on the galaxy s3, but they still have these nature sound effects. These bloop and noises that I've disabled add to disable them pretty much immediately for my own sanity. I wish they would clean up this nouns and actually, I think I would have a surprisingly big affect on how you perceive the user interface, but other than that. Thanks to the specs, the s5 is pretty quick, its responsive. There isn't really any lag in most places, but when you do find lag like in the gallery, for example, it's bad, like I mean for a high-end flagship phone with monster. Specs like this, the phone really does have the slowest gallery. So when you do find lag, you'll notice it, but TouchWiz is pretty much exactly as you'd expect. Colourful, big, bold and constantly pushing Samsung features. One of those Samsung features being my magazine, which is the pane that sits to the left of your home screens like blinkfeed or Google. Now it's kind of this news, aggregator like blink feed and just talks to Flipboard, basically pulls in some cool stories, very beautiful imagery and uses the entire 5.1 inch display. I mean it does what it's supposed to it's just a matter of whether you want it there or not. Also it can't be disabled or hidden like blinkfeed ken now. Another notable thing here is the settings menu. Actually, I thought it was in my galaxy s4 review that I mentioned that Samsung really needs to change the way they organise their settings. Basically because there were so many and they needed a search box. But this is absolutely not what I meant, I didn't mean put them all in a grid of 60, something colorful icons that I have to scroll through to find what I want holy crap. There are just way too many for that, so I maintain Samsung should really find a better way to handle all of the device settings than this there's a grid view. There'S a list view either way. There are just too many uh-huh, but yeah, I don't know. I guess that you touch was just isn't my favorite plenty of people will not have a problem with it at all. Obviously, if you've used the galaxy s3 or you've used the galaxy s4 and you like it, this experience here will be very similar and there are other plenty of new useful features. The editable, quick notification settings are really useful. There'S also a feature called toolbox that lets you store any five apps in this bubble that you can move around and it gives you quick access from that bubble to those apps anywhere. So, no matter where you are you just tap it and it brings up your favorite app list. It'S nifty. I actually left that on and use it for a quite a bit. So these are the types of things that will get you to like the phone. More and even if the things that you like aren't enabled by default, you'll, probably find something buried in the settings somewhere that you can and making a much more enjoyable user experience. Now I mentioned at the beginning of the video that the Galaxy s5 has basically identical. Specs to the One m8, except for a few key areas, one of those key areas is sitting on the back here of this phone you'll notice, this lens protrudes from the body a bit. It'S that 16 megapixel camera. This camera is excellent and I'll immediately go on record and say it's one of the top 5 smartphone cameras. You can get right now. It is very, very good now. Maybe it's because I spent too much time with the 4 megapixel camera on the one m8, but basically the shots. I'M taking I'm noticing a few key characteristics again here, one very, very detailed tons of resolution and detail at 16, megapixels and 2. There are very saturated photos and colorful in pretty much any conditions, so the camera interface is pretty standard. Samsung stuff, not you know too overly simple. You know Samsung next, to give you a ton of options, there's lots of effects and things you can play with and change. You can take 4k video. You have software stabilization, you have HDR the whole deal. You have something here, also called selective focus which again might ring a bell from the One m8. I'Ve done a little bit differently here. Basically, it instructs you to take a photo of something close with an auto focus background, and it takes a pair of photos for you, one that focuses on the foreground and one that focuses on the background. But lets you pick between them using just one button for a near focus or far focus, but what I really liked was actually the pan focus button which actually lets you grab everything in focus at the same time, which can actually be really useful and let you Get a whole shot, a whole composition right through some software processing. So here we have another version, you can see near focus, far focus and then pan focus. Obviously, it's not perfect and that's a a pretty artificial effect, but the ability to switch this stuff on the fly on your phone with a single button press is pretty neat. I think a lot of people like that. So basically, I found myself taking a lot more pictures with the galaxy s5. Just because of how good the camera looks, how good the pictures look on the phone so there's an awesome display combined with a 16 megapixel shot and that really lets you grab detail from the smallest things and blow them up. The images look really razor sharp. Now, obviously, if you zoom in a ton, you'll see smaller imperfections and laura's, but this stuff you'll have trouble doing on pretty much any other smartphone camera 16 megapixels gives you a lot of room to play with it's, not 41, it's not 50, but you guys know. I love pixels and it's it's awesome to see this much detail in color in a quick shot like this and the ability to shoot 4k video is a sweet bonus, so a nice job on the camera Samsung, but hold up a minute. What is below the camera? What is going on there, that is not an extra depth sensor or anything fancy for imaging that is actually a heart rate, monitor yeah a special hardware to measure your heart rate. Obviously, s-health is still a thing that Samsung does so they've plugged into that sensor. On the back of the phone, and essentially, if you hold your finger there for a few seconds, it'll give you a reading of your heart rate in beats per minute. Now I don't actually know how accurate this is, because I don't have another heart rate sensor to control, but it's a neat feature. It'S a neat demo to bolster the S health portfolio of things. It can do it's a pedometer and Harvey monitor whatever its s, health. So anyway, yeah, if you're not getting the picture by now. Basically, the galaxy s5 is an improvement in a lot of ways over the Galaxy s4 and a lot of smartphone enthusiasts tend to see that, as I guess, a bad thing, because they really didn't like the galaxy s4 or they were expecting a bigger change. But for the many millions of people who will inevitably buy this phone, that's actually great. The galaxy s4 was a solid phone and this phone improves on it in a lot of important ways. So so what if this phone looks like a band-aid in gold? Get it in black or get it in white, get it in blue. You know it's great. It'S a high-end phone with a ton of features its water-resistant. It has an excellent battery life that nobody should have any problems with. It has a beautiful large colorful bright display easily the best mo LED display in the business on a smart phone right. Now it's lightweight it's made of some cheap materials sure but you're coming from the s4, so you're, probably not gon na notice and really the only real downside I have with TouchWiz is or with the galaxy s5 is TouchWiz and its quirks, and I guess the speaker, A little bit too, but TouchWiz will continue to evolve and right now the galaxy s5 really is the galaxy s4 s that I called it in my first impressions. Video so don't mind me, I'm just sit back over here and quietly cross. My fingers waiting for a google play edition of this song because the new google camera came out today and it's great and i like stock Android and I feel like I would really enjoy a Google Play edition galaxy s5. But in the meantime there it is. This is the Samsung Galaxy s5, thanks for watching guys and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace """
pwsPZi_JRrA,HTC One M8 Review!,15:38,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm KB HD here - and this is the long-awaited full review of the brand new HTC One m8. So really, when you're talking about the One m8 from HTC last year's m7 was a killer in terms of design, and when you compare it to its feature, flagship rival from Samsung the galaxy s5, they actually have basically identical internal specs, which means the design in the Physical way, it feels, in the hand, is more important than ever, and it literally couldn't be a bigger difference between the two so I'll be comparing them in a separate video later. But if you watch any of the promo material for the m8 you'll notice, it's all about that design and the build quality and the material choices. And that's really where this phone excels. That'S its highlight and it's the same material we have of the old HTC One. But it's obviously a little bit bigger a little bit more round and in a few different colors that are obviously inspired by some close competition. So this we have here is the silver m8 and now, like I said it's more rounded and HTC likes to boast a certain stat that the old HTC One exterior was made of 70 % metal, and this new one m8 is 90 % metal. And that's true, but because of this change actually think the old one fit better in the hand, see the sides of the phone were flat and sure: that's you know the polycarbonate not metal, but it gave you an edge like something that actually grabbed onto while holding The phone it was flat, the new HTC one rounds this off with more metal. So, yes, it is noir. Now you know 90 % metal versus 70 %, but now there's no edge to hold on to its just a slippery smooth, anodized aluminum, all the way around. The phone, and also since this phone is a bit larger to accommodate that bigger 5-inch display bigger than last year's. The whole chassis is a bit bigger, and that makes it a little bit harder to reach that top power button, which is moved from the left side. To the right side on the top of the device, but if we're being honest here, I think the power button is in wrong place entirely. I think it should be on the right side of the phone where it's easier to reach with one hand, especially for people with smaller hands, but at least it's a little bit better than last year. But one thing that's not in the wrong place. At least to me is the headphone jack it's on the bottom of the phone here, and that is where I like it. Also. The whole top of the phone is an IR blaster, so you can turn on and off your TV with an included app and on top of all that there is expandable storage in this sealed phone. So there's a tray on both the right and left side of this phone. The left side is where you'd put your SIM card, but the right side will fit and support a micro SD card up to a hundred and twenty eight gigs. A hundred and twenty eight gigabytes, that is ridiculous, and you know what I'll drop 128 gig microSD card link in the description, if you don't believe me very useful for storing movies or apps or music and stuff offline. Now I am a tall person and I use big phones because I have big hands, but still even such a tall phone because of that back material of being so slippery. It'S a little bit weird to hold and I definitely find myself using two hands to hold it a lot of times, but really because of that power. Button placement there's a lot of movement going on in the hand, and I really would have rather had it on the side of the phone. But overall, it's obvious that this is designed to be a premium feeling phone and I think it definitely accomplishes that a lot of people are going to hear the speakers and immediately think wow. That'S really nice! A lot of people are going to see the display and immediately think wow. That'S really nice and just feeling this phone next to something like a galaxy s5 or an iPhone or an LG g3. It'S gon na feel very different in the hand and that's very important to people in the store when they're about to buy it and then, when they're, using it. Now. As long as we're talking about hardware, there's a certain feature on the back of this phone that people just can't stop talking about, and that is the camera or the dual cameras on the back. If CC got a lot of feedback last year with the old HTC One S, camera that ultra pixel camera a lot of positive, but also a lot of negative in terms of the photos that it took and the features that you got out of it. But HTC decided to go ahead and keep that ultra pixel camera. So it's still a 4 megapixel sensor on the back with that main element, and then they had wooden head and added some stuff in subtracted some stuff out. Obviously, so it's worth going in-depth technical. This camera, so in terms of specs here we're looking at another four megapixel camera, dubbed the ultra pixel camera. Again this year, a two tone LED flash similar to the iPhone 5s and a secondary two megapixel depth sensor to keep it simple, and this sensor is used for a couple of interesting software effects. We'Ll talk about the system is called duo. Camera now, notably missing that we saw in the m7, is optical image stabilization, so the camera software, the interface which you can get to just by rotating the phone sideways and capping that volume button is quite nice, simple, very clean, very intuitive and ridiculously fast, like it's Very, very, very fast, focusing and fast taking shots. It'S the closest thing I've experienced to instant shutter on any Android device. I love that and there's some flexibility when taking regular shots with this manual mode, which lets you manually change ISO and exposure and actually save those settings as a custom camera. If you want so there's a lot you can do here. The software is a nice blend between simplicity and capability, like you can really control a lot. If you know what you're doing or you can just leave it alone and take nice shots in Auto, and then there is the duo camera so after you've taken a shot and you open it up in the gallery. You'Ve picked your shot and you hit that edit button. You see a couple of effects along the bottom and these are called the duo camera effects and these will appear when your shot is compatible. So the most well-known one is called you focus which lets you tap. The part of the photo you want in focus and it'll use software algorithms to blur the rest of the photo and try to reproduce a natural bokeh that you would get from a really nice camera or some nice glass now to the untrained eye. This can look pretty nice, especially on the phone smaller screen, but I know that they can keep working on it and making it better since they're updating it through the Play Store, but a lot of times. We find the effect looks pretty artificial and sometimes it just doesn't work at all. I mentioned the photo being compatible before I found that you have to be very careful when you use this focus effect. Your photo needs to have a very obvious subject and a very obvious background, but you'll need to be far away enough that when you take your photo, everything is already in focus so that it can select what's in focus after the fact. So if you do this right, you don't make for the best Easi. You focus effect after the fact. But if you get too close, where the background is naturally bored already you're, never gon na get it back by clicking on it and it looks terrible. So you really have to take an obvious foreground and background photo to get this to work now. Of course, there are some other effects for Grindr is pretty cool lets. You add effects to only the background to really isolate the subject or dimension Plus, which uses that extra depth information from the second sensor to make this trippy 3d image that responds to the gyroscope of the phone. They get really cool stuff. That looks okay on the phone, but really not that great anywhere else. Now, when it comes to the actual photo quality of the photos it takes, there are some really strong characteristics of a photo from the m8 that you can see like a mile away. One really poor dynamic range: it either crushes the darks or blows out. The highlights, like every time, is a pretty nice, but also pretty dull exposure, sometimes underexposed. It really doesn't like taking an image and making it too bright, but also tends to have under saturated colors and three is the resolution. Obviously it's coming in at just 4 megapixels, which is of course not terrible, but it means that the front-facing selfie camera fun fact is actually a higher resolution coming in at 5 megapixels for those super detailed, Instagram selfies. So, overall verdict with the camera on this guy is it's pretty good? It'S ok again those 4 megapixel photos. They look fine on your display on your phone and they'll. Look fine sending it to the web as long as you're, not viewing it blowing up huge as long as you're, not printing it if you're not looking at it on a 4k display, if you're not zooming in at all, it looks fun and a lot of those Effects again will look really cool, because you can't see that it's only 4 megapixels, but if you're looking, if you're a photo enthusiast, if you really inspect pixel peep those photos a lot and you do a lot of editing and share them on more than just the Web you're gon na want to check out some of the 8 12 even 16 megapixel photos on cameras like the galaxy s3, s5 and Note 3 and others so definitely not the best camera on the market, but it's certainly decent mid-range. I would say - and I would have loved to have optical image stabilization back anyway, there's a bit to be said about the software. Besides the cameras off where this is HTC Sense, 6, on top of Android 4.4 - and I think it's my favorite skin on top of Android right now, now don't get me wrong. I still love stock Android and I would still take that any day of the week and I have a lot to say about the Google Play edition of this phone, but this version of HTC software since 6:00 is the least obtrusive. Yet it really feels like an adjustment to Android rather than a layer on top of it. Performance is also excellent throughout. Obviously, since this thing is powered by top-notch hardware at top-notch, graphics, opening and closing apps and flipping through your daily user interface, super quick everything is very, very responsive and you'd probably expect that and it looks kind of nice like I said it feels like an adjustment To stock Android, one nice touch, I've noticed is the notification bar color changes depending on where you are in the phone. So if you're in the home screen or the lockscreen, the notification bar is clear, but in certain HCC apps, the color of the notification bar changes to match the app so in blinkfeed, for example, to the left of your home screens. It changes to green to match and it does it quite smoothly and all the other stock HTC apps that come with the phone have their own color and they have that effect on the notification bar and, I guess non HTC apps, just change it to gray. So yeah I'm liking that it's a nice touch and little things like this are sprinkled here and there inside of Sense, 6 to really spice up the design, and I do think it looks nice also HTC stepped up the display size so we're looking at a 5-inch 1080P display here now, instead of 4.7, and that gives us on-screen buttons for Sense 6 to work with so your software home back and multitasking button, and you can also swipe up to get to Google now like on a nexus. Unfortunately, they kept that chin bar on the phone with the HTC logo on it, but I've been told by a few that they needed to keep the device this tall to fit all the components, including those massive beautiful boomsound speakers. In fact, let's talk about the speakers. Let'S talk about them, they are awesome they're, the best. Why aren't they standard actually is my question. They make every single other phone, literally every other phone sound like crap. Honestly, you can't get much better of an audio experience in a phone than this. You get a much more immersive gaming, I actually enjoy watching YouTube videos and listening in music on this phone. The alarm clock is ridiculously loud in the morning, which I guess is also good, and the drivers are so big and so far apart, they actually get a bit of a stereo effect. When things move across the screen in a good movie, it's brilliant. I love it. So I have nothing bad to say about the speakers other than the fact that they are so big that they make the phone really tall and HTC has also come up with a way to combat the phone's tallness. Since the power button is kind of hard to reach, they come up with a few ways to turn the display on without ever touching that awkwardly placed power button. So this stuff might remind you of LG's flagships, so you can DoubleTap the phone when it's upright to turn the screen on. That'S nifty. You can swipe down when the screen is off and that will start voice calling which unfortunately sucks at recognizing voices. It'S not Google recognition, but it's there and it works. You can swipe left to bring your home screen up. So, if you're in an app or something - and you swipe left from the off screen, it'll bring you right home again. It always goes to your home screen and same with swiping right that'll always bring you to blinkfeed wherever you are so again, you could be in an app or doing something and if you have your screen off and you swipe right, you'll get right into blinkfeed. Lastly, you can swipe up and that'll bring you to just wherever you were last. So if you were in an app or your home screen wherever you were, and you swipe up you'll be brought right back to that screen. You left off that. So, with all this knowledge, in theory, you'll never need to touch the power button again, except to turn the screen off. So HTC is doing some really nice stuff with sense, including pulling a Motorola and making a couple of them like the gallery and the dot view case functionality available in the Google Play Store, which can be updated really quickly and for free. Now all that being said, I do have the Google Play edition of the One m8 in house so thumbs up. If you want to see your a separate video review of that, but a lot of these features from Sense. Six that are moved to the Play Store will also be available on the Google Play edition, which is why I have a lot to say about why the Google Play edition is probably going to be my most used phone. I'M really liking. The Google Play edition HTC. One m8, but if you're in it for the sense features you're, probably gon na, want to get the traditional one. Another thing I was impressed with with this phone was the now it is a sealed, FAQ phone. You can't get into this and swap out the battery, but it's got a sealed in 2600 milliamp hour battery, it's a little bigger than the old HTC one you all. At least you see, one didn't have the best battery life in the world, but this thing is great: it is a power sipper. I would not have any problem recommending going a whole weekend with this phone with light use. I'Ve gotten two full days of use out of this phone and it's definitely a very light battery user when you're not really using it a whole ton and even one that 5-inch 1080p display is on and you're gaming and you're using it a lot. It doesn't burn through battery, like some other phones that views, so this is one of the best batteries in the market, even though it's not a 3000 milliamp hour battery or 3300 milliamp hours. It'S still great I'll show you some of the usage stats. I'Ve gotten out of it, but typically I can get through a full day pretty easily. With this phone I haven't been able to wear it down in a typical 24 hour use period, so very impressive there and something else. That'S even I guess. Like a small thing, I usually don't use auto-brightness on phones. I usually manually control the brightness because they tend to have some weird sensitivity problems, but this is one of the first ones in a while, but I'm okay with the way uses, auto brightness outside turns it all. The way up inside turns it down to a comfortable level, I'm happy with the auto brightness on this phone. I usually don't even have to talk about that. So overall I got ta say this phone has a lot of good things going for it, and I've enjoyed the hell out of using it. For the time that I have and like I said, I do have a lot to say about the Google Play edition of this phone. So again, that's probably gon na end up being an entire separate review video. But for now I got to say this is one of the best ones you can buy, go in a store, try it out. You'Re, probably gon na, like holding it and that's gon na, be a good reason to buy it by itself, because the specs are so similar to other flagships so check it out. I don't have any reservations about this phone, even if you aren't a huge fan of the camera, it takes good enough shots that this is probably one of the best phones. You can buy right now. It'S the One m8 thanks for watching guys and I'll talk to you guys in the next one bass. """
RwnSX-3ncSA,New Mac Pro Review!,9:02,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm KB HD here - and this is the late 2013 early 2014 Mac Pro and yes, it is very, very small, see this is a weird little desktop from Apple, so for the past decade or so, Apple has been slowly moving away from The pro market, from their software all the way through to their hardware, PC sales, have been slowing down their iPads and iPhones have become way more popular and money-making, and there's just really not that much money in professional workstation grade machines anymore and for a while Apple. Just straight-up ignored the whole pro market and for years never updated the Mac Pro until now and about 1. So this review is actually coming from a bit of a different perspective versus the typical Mac Pro buyer, the normal Mac Pro buyer from maybe 2007 up until the latest generation. Before this, one would have the Mac Pro sitting dormant in a corner of a studio somewhere and would use it to power their displays for music production or video production or whatever they do. The typical Mac Pro buyer doesn't use it as a full-time, workhorse and everyday machine. So that's where my review is coming in as someone who's actually going to be using this everyday for stuff. Like you know, web browsing the typical everyday light load stuff and I also happen to do some production as well. So that's the way this review is sort of framed. So the main thing about this new Mac Pro is its size. Obviously it's much smaller than not only the previous generation Mac Pro, but really any other desktop computer, let alone a high-end one. It'S really the only desktop that you can hold like this. At least I'm pretty sure it is anyway, but the thing is that doesn't really matter much. I mean it's a 10 inch tall 11 pound cylinder that in theory you could put in a backpack and bring wherever you want as a sort of a portable studio with you. But that is a very, very small group of people actually doing that plus you need to monitor anyway, but Apple is still very proud of how small they've made this machine. They talk about it all over their site and in all their promo material, and you know that that that is pretty impressive. Still it's smaller than some full-size graphics cards. It kind of forces itself on your desk with that shape and reflective aluminum shell, of course, because it is this small. It makes the cooling situation pretty interesting now as far as heat and noise and thermals go Apple in general has a long history of cooling things as little as possible, mainly because apple hates moving parts. I mean you, don't have to look very far in other Apple products to see that so as far as fans go, there is just one single fan: cooling every component in this workstation great desktop I'll, say that again there is one fan, cooling this whole desktop. Now it is small and there is a lot of hype about it, but it's what they call the thermal core and it actually does a surprisingly good job. So the way the thermal core works is this. You essentially have all the components of the Mac Pro in this case. That'S the graphics cards, the terabyte of flash storage, the eight core Xeon processor and all the RAM, the motherboard everything all up against the three sides of the prism on the inside. It looks like a triangle from above, and the center of it is empty, and this is where the air flows from the bottom to the top cooling all of the parts with the same airflow. So these vents you see on the bottom of the Mac Pro yeah. You do not want to block those, because that is all of the intake. That'S where it's in taking all the cool air and the single fan we talked about is up top sucking air through the whole system and because it's such a large fan, it actually doesn't have to spin very fast to move a lot of air and actually found The thermal core to be really effective. It kept the system at a reasonable temperature, pretty much, no matter how hard I pushed it and video editing with Adobe Premiere and After Effects. I really got the fan to spin up, I mean the thing is pretty much silent. Strangely, the only time I could actually get the fan to spin loud enough to even hear it and it's three feet away on. My desk was watching a bunch of YouTube videos in a row. So thanks, Adobe Flash anyway, this thermal core is such a boss. At cooling it works so well that performance on this mac pro is also fantastic. It all just flies through mac OS 10 mavericks, as you would expect, i mean it costs a pretty penny. You would expect it to fly through its native OS and it does. I'Ve had absolutely no hiccups, it outperforms the hackintosh pro I built. It flies through apps, like no other machine, I've ever owned and it's an absolute breeze to use during everyday single-threaded tasks. So that's good news now personally, when I get to the more heavy stuff take advantage of all eight cores. Like I mentioned, I use Adobe Premiere and a bit of After Effects like I said for video editing, and these apps are clearly not optimized. For this new hardware, because I actually don't really see a difference in performance between the Mac Pro and the hack Pro I built and used for so long. Some of this has to do with the fact that it's a beast of a workstation GPU, not a regular gaming graphics card, so the d700 Adobe just doesn't know how to talk to them yet and really it's up to Adobe at this point to get this system In their hands test, it optimize it for this new hardware and push out the updates to all of us Mac Pro users, because I would love to see the improvements that Apple's Final Cut users are seeing on this Mac with the Adobe suite, but either way. I'M not going to drill through benchmarks again for that. I will refer you to the Mac Pro performance review, video that I did it'll be linked right below that like button. If you want to check out how it compared against my hackintosh pro and another Mac that I've used also another youtuber, Armando Ferreira, put together a PC for the same budget as this Mac Pro and ran benchmarks of his own on that side. So, of course, it's still running Windows, but with that video also linked below you can get a better sense of how you'll do with the price to performance ratio. Now. Another thing you have to talk about is the i/o on the new Mac Pro because it's a little bit different from the old Mac Pro, but it's also very different from most other desktops as a workstation you're, getting four USB 3.0 ports you're getting six Thunderbolt 2.0 Ports you're getting two ethernet jacks and you're getting hdmi 1.4. That is, it now actually have a seven port, USB 3.0 hub that I used. I don't think USB. Expandability is a problem, but that brings us to the biggest difference between this Mac Pro and the old Mac Pro, not just the size, but that's the difference between the words upgradability and expandability. This new Mac Pro is a hundred percent upgradable, which you can't actually even say about the old Mac Pro, but it is not internally expandable, you have to expand through thunderbolt 2.0 and if you can't get what you want done through thunderbolt 2.0, this machine is not For you, this is going to affect a lot of people who are using PCI based solutions like they were on the old Mac Pro. There are no open PCI ports in the new Mac Pro. So if you want something like a red rocket or a new video card, or something like that, it has to be done through Thunderbolt right now that situation doesn't look as promising or as friendly as we might want it to be, but hopefully in the near future. There'S way more Thunderbolt accessories that were previously PCI accessories. So at the end of the day, is the Mac Pro a good buy right? Now it's not going to seem like a good buy, because you know the Adobe apps aren't optimized, there's a whole bunch of things missing in terms of expansion, and it doesn't really look like a complete package and people aren't exactly throwing away their old Mac Pros or Imax, who are working on production just yet those will still have their place in the studio, but for me as a person who's using it as a full-time machine as a person who uses it every single day and also does production. I feel like it's been a really great investment and, of course, there's a whole bunch of different Mac, Pro's, the four core, the six core, the eight core and the twelve core I feel like. I did actually make the right choice. As I explained in the performance video with the eight core Mac Pro as a sort of a balance between single threaded and multi-threaded apps, so basically there's going to be a ton of overpriced, trashcan jokes. We already know that people who haven't made it this far in the video probably have already left that comment below, but the idea here is: it's got a future ahead of it. There is not going to be another new Mac Pro for probably ten more years as we've seen with the old Mac Pro in the history of the way. Apple has updated it. So you know come back to me in 2018 and maybe we'll have a totally different story to tell about this new interesting, innovative small compact, Darth Vader, looking machine that we call the Mac Pro either way. That'S been it. Thank you for watching hope. You enjoyed this review video again I'll leave the links to the performance review. I did of the Mac Pro and of the unboxing and first impressions down right below that like button. If you want to check them out, thanks for watching I'll talk to you guys in the next video peace member """
lVPAfntOfmc,Nokia Lumia 1520 Review!,7:37,"Hey what is up guys, i'm kim Bhd here - and this is the nokia lumia 1520 alright, so I've done a few windows phone reviews over the course of this year, my most recent being the Lumia 1020, and this one here is my favorite. You guys know I like pixels and yes, that does have something to do with it, but basically because the software is so similar to the Lumia 1020 and the 920 and 925 and most of the others. I'M going to focus here on the new hardware, because this is the best Windows Phone hardware, yet now right off the bat. Yes, it's bigger than other Windows phones and that might put some people off because these phones weren't exactly small to begin with. But you get an exceptionally well built phone here as you'd expect with the Lumia it's the 1520 and the back. Has this matte white coating it's a little bit thicker and a little bit heavier than some other phones, but you get this unibody enclosure and this entire phone basically has no scenes not even in the corners. So your grip is never interrupted, no matter how you hold this phone and this phone feels really great in the hand again, it helps to have bigger hands if you're going to hold a bigger phone like this in one hand, but essentially it's it's a great feeling. Phone, you can also get this phone in a couple of other colors like red or yellow or black, I believe, and maybe blue, but I'm liking this stormtrooper look now. This phone has specs that put it on top of just about everything and anything released this year. Android iOS Windows Phone, anything. First of all, it's the first 1080p Windows Phone. That'S a big part of why I picked it up to check it out. In the first place, it's rocking a six inch 1080p display which puts it at about 376 per inch. Very sharp and it looks much better than the display on the Lumia 1020. If you remember my review of that beast in yellow it actually had a 720p display, and I could see some pixels in some UI elements that were only supposed to be one pixel wide. Well, the higher pixel density here on the 1520 basically eliminates that problem and everything looks great on it, along with the of course, awesome viewing angles great colors everything, so the display on the Lumia 1520 is killer. Now, along with being the first Windows Phone to have a 1080p display, this is not the only place where it's the king of specs check it out. This has the 2.2 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 800, the Adreno 330 GPU, which is brand new. The 2 gigabytes of RAM Gorilla Glass LTE, it has a 20 megapixel camera with Zeiss glass and a xenon flash, and basically every single bell or whistle possible. This phone is basically fully loaded, so with great specs comes great performance throughout launching apps and multitasking everything you would expect and with the larger 1080p display in Windows, Phone comes more tiles, which is actually really important like a lot more tiles. This is actually nice for Windows Phone so because these live tiles actually give you a lot of glanceable information, they're kind of like widgets. In a way, the way they work on Android, you have so many more pixels to play with in Windows Phone that you can basically get all your live tiles in one big, glanceable sort of billboard style and get all your information at once, without even having to Scroll, so that's a big thing: you just flat-out cannot do on any other Windows Phone because you don't have this 1920 by 1080. Big gorgeous 6 inch display. So you do have the trade-off of the phone itself being a little bit bigger. But you have just such a nice comfortable layout now, with all the space to work with and a last benefit you get from all these awesome. Specs and hardware is performance, of course, just ridiculously good performance. So, first of all, let me just say that Internet Explorer on Windows Phone is actually pretty good like it may not have as many features as something like chrome on Android or Safari on iOS. But it's extremely fast here and I was not bothered at all by using it. I didn't feel the need to scout out any different web browser from the App Store, because page loading was plenty fast and frame rates kept up with me, zooming in and out was extremely smooth, basically kept up with everything I did and that's what I look for In a mobile web browser, so Internet Explorer, he was very good and performance was also great in games. One area I found a lot more functional and Windows Phone was the game section. I guess now that I have an Xbox, so it's easy. It'S really easy to enjoy us a game on a 6 inch 1080p display when you have the newest Snapdragon, 800 Adreno 330 GPU powering your gaming experience. You really can't go wrong here, so the only thing you might find is that you may wish there were more great graphically intensive games in the Windows Phone Marketplace. I feel like if there was anything in the Windows Phone store to challenge this phone or push it to his limits. I couldn't find it so which I guess is more of a compliment to the phone than a complaint, but yeah the App Store is growing. Every time I come back to it and try Windows Phone, so that's a good sign, but there is another thing where performance is great is in gaming and then another place where performance is great. I can't really talk about this phone without talking about the camera. So obviously the Lumia 1020 I reviewed earlier - had a great camera 41 megapixels. But this camera experience on the 15 20, I think, is every bit as good. You might not have the same resolution, but you still have 20 megapixels um xenon, flash Carl Zeiss glass and the same awesome Nokia, pro cam, app that the Lumia 1020 had. So all of this means extremely high quality photos and a lot of control over taking them. In all kinds of light, in all types of situations, always great colors and high detail, and you can still crop down the 20 megapixel shots to zoom in on something afterwards. It might not be 40 megapixels, but he'll 20 is still a lot of pixels and rarely you think about it, but not that many phones have 20 megapixel cameras either today. So that's pretty impressive, so yeah! This is nearly flawless hardware. Objectively speaking, everything about this phone was high quality to me, it even gets a lot of the little things right. The speaker quality is really good. The earpiece quality on your calls is really good. The battery life with the massive 3400 milliamp hour battery is really really good. The video quality from the camera, your 1080p video with optical image stabilization, is really good. The button layout for the phone on the most part - I mean it's a big phone, but I think it's laid out appropriately for being a big phone. So that was really good so again, and it also happens to have this incredible, beautiful, fit and finish that you expect from the Nokia Lumia build quality. The only thing that might be a problem with this phone is with the future of Windows Phone getting updates since apparently the next version of Windows Phone is supposed to move to on green buttons, but we don't even really know this for sure. So I think it's pretty safe to say that the Lumia 1520 has provided the best Windows Phone experience to date, and I love it. So that's basically it there's been your full review. This is one of my favorite phones of the year and I'm glad, I'm glad to say it's a Windows Phone, because I really love the diversity of the breadth of my favorite phones of 2013 and, of course, there's much more about that coming up soon and it's A holiday season, so there's many more videos upcoming.

KFD0Nm2dOHw,Motorola Moto G Review!,9:31,"Hey what is up guys, I'm cabby HD here - and this is the Moto G you've probably heard of it by now, if you've watched my videos, but basically I don't tend to talk about the price of the devices that I'm reviewing in the video review itself. First of all, prices tend to fluctuate and something that's a bad deal one day could be a great deal in price the next. So this is actually not one of those devices. This moto G costs starts out a hundred and seventy nine dollars for this smartphone off-contract, which is a ridiculously good deal and always will be a ridiculously good deal. That'S super low in terms of price for an off contract smartphone. So why is it that cheap? Do you feel like there has to be something missing something wrong with it. There'S got to be a reason why the Moto G is so cheap. So that's exactly what I've looked into and if you've watched my Moto X review earlier this year. You probably know plenty about that phone already, so the easiest way to tell you guys and show you why this phone is so cheap is to compare all the things that are different between the Moto X and the Moto G, and that's exactly what we're gon na Do so, let's go ahead and get into that first off look at the packaging because it actually starts there in order to get a smartphone down to this ridiculous price, that's accessible by almost anyone. You need to cut every corner possible, so the Moto G unboxing is super simple you'll just get the phone on top and a USB cable for charging and data. That'S it! No wall adapter, no headphones, no SIM card, ejector tool, nothing fancy, just the necessities and the same philosophy, of course goes into the phone itself. You don't get anything fancy nothing extra over the top at all. Just the necessities done very well, but getting to the outsides of these two devices. There are some physical differences between the Moto X and Moto G, starting with the way it feels in the hand, as the Moto G is just a little bit thicker and a little bit heavier than the Moto X. The designs of the phones are, of course, super similar with the same back design and slight curve and used to hold in the hand, and even the same awesome dimple that I love so much from the Moto X. But the spec sheet will show that. Not only is the Moto G, a tiny bit thicker and a tiny bit heavier, but there's also some internal shortcuts taken for cost. First of all, Moto maker, the customization of all the colors and the accents and built in the USA, yet that's expensive. So there won't be with moto G, but there will be a sort of a do-it-yourself moto maker with a back that snaps off. So you can actually take the back off the Moto G and replace it with another back end a number of different colors, but something that some ruble back does not allow you to do is add, storage or replace the battery. So the only thing available is the slot for the nano SIM card. Otherwise you are locked into your 8 or 16 gigabytes of storage and that battery is non removable. But speaking of that battery, this is actually one of the most impressive parts of the phone physically. It is technically slightly smaller, it's a 2070 milliamp hour battery, which is smaller than the one in the Moto X, but in actual everyday use it's still lasted quite a while, with great standby time, an average of I'd, say three hours or so of screen-on time, which Is enough to last a full day of regular use and I'm going to go ahead and attribute that to the other internals, the operating system and aspects so running near stock Android 4.3. Jelly bean here is the quad-core Snapdragon 400 and a full one gigabyte of RAM. Now these are obviously way lower end specs than the Moto X, but in this price bracket a quad core chip is pretty ridiculous. It'S good to see it's. The quad core version of the Snapdragon, 400 and performance was also very impressive. For the price I mean, I was able to play some pretty graphically intensive games, not in 1080p, obviously, but still without dropping any frames, and it looks a very playable - and I could also you know, browse the web and multitask and open and close apps without a Hitch now this is definitely not as quick as the Moto X. Don'T get me wrong, I mean you can tell that you're working with one gig of ram here, it's not unbearable, but you'll notice that things will take a little bit longer as if you're working with less ram and slightly less processing power. In fact, I'd say the biggest bottleneck is actually the processing power and not the graphics, because sometimes I had press to open an app and the process would clearly begin opening on the screen. But then graphically you'd have to use the processor to catch up to where the graphics had gotten to basically the responsiveness of the Moto X, if the most, if the responsiveness of the Moto X is a perfect 10 out of 10, the Moto G would give me About us, seven, so you're working with slightly different specs to get you slightly different performance, but when you consider the hue difference in price, well, that's just something you got ta love now, you're, also working with a different display here on the front. So moto G has a slightly bigger bezel, all around the whole device and it's rocking a little smaller 4.5 inch, 720p display and it's an LCD display instead of AMOLED. Now, brightness and viewing angles were totally not a problem for this LCD display, but colors were definitely noticeably different, maybe a bit warmer and a little bit less accurate, but definitely not on pleasing at all to look at just a little bit off now, because this is An IPS display and a Snapdragon 400, not an X 8 chip, you're gon na be missing a few of the biggest software features of the Moto X that rely on those things active notifications, the twist to the camera and active listening. So the active notifications from the X, where you turn over your phone and get those few pixels that light up and indicate the time and your most recent notifications that stuff requires an o le D display to work properly and not kill your battery. So you'll have to use the Moto G like a normal phone, and the x8 chip in the X has sensors for detecting gestures and voice dictation. But the Snapdragon 400 here in the Moto G does not have that. So if you twist to try to open the camera like on the Moto G, nothing will happen. It'S not listening for that and no matter how loud you shout. Ok, Google! Now at it it's not going to respond, because it's not listening for that either. Now I don't know how you feel about these features. You may really really really want them or you may not care at all and I think chances are if you're picking up a sub $ 200 phone like this, you probably are in the second category. Now there are three main things missing with connectivity on the Moto G number. One is there's no 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi band kind of a minor annoyance. If you ask me if it's such a cheap phone number 2 is there's no NFC and that's a little bit of a bigger annoyance for people - and you know an NFC chip is really really inexpensive these days, but again, they're cutting corners everywhere to get to a Price, this low and number 3 there's no LTE. Now the Moto G is an international device and in a lot of the markets, where you're gon na see this phone popping up and being really popular, LTE isn't a big deal at all. So this is actually not that surprising and NFC is sort of the biggest omission. I think that you would expect to see in this device now. The camera on the back of the Moto G is something that's really interesting. It'S made me reconsider a lot of the way, I think about cameras and smartphones. It'S a five megapixel shooter. So it's way less resolution than the Moto X or a lot of the other stuff. We'Ve looked at this year, but obviously the quality is not going to be that great. But if you care about quality, if you care about the photo quality or resolution or video, and you have $ 179 to spend, you can go out and buy a decent $ 179 point-shoot camera on Amazon, and it still might not take much better video or photo Than the Moto G, so, if you think about it, I'm really impressed that there is even a camera at all in the Moto G. I remember the first Nexus 7 in order to hit that magical $ 199 price point didn't have a camera at all and we kind of dismissed that because it's a tablet, but that's one of the emissions they made to cut down on price. So the fact that the Moto G even has a camera at all, that's even okay for one hundred and seventy nine dollars is incredible. So, basically, at the end of the day, what I'm trying to say here is the Moto G is an incredible deal for $ 179. You cannot buy a better smartphone period and availability is also really good when this device gets Android 4.4 KitKat, which, if you watch my interview with the CEO of Motorola, Dennis Woodside, he promised that this device would get it in January and I got the US version. So I'd be waiting for that in January. Well, this gets KitKat, it's going to be an incredible phone, even more than it already is. Kitkat has lower system requirements and runs better on lower-end devices, and this is a prime scenario where you could take great advantage of that. If you want to say my top 5 best features of Android 4.4 KitKat I'll. Have that link right below the like button, but essentially there's a lot to love about this phone before KitKat and when it gets KitKat. It'S gon na be awesome even more awesome. So when you need to think about whether or not this is the phone for you to buy for yourself, consider the following question: is this to you, the highest end low end device or the lowest end high end device? Because if you're looking for a high end device, this is not it, and this is not really as the way I see it. It'S not the lowest end high end device. I see it as the highest end low end device. If that makes sense to you, it is an incredible value. It gets way better performance than any other device in this price for reference. Here'S another phone that right now costs 179 dollars. It'S not something you want to buy right now, but you can for the same price as you can get a moto G. I think the choice is clear, but it's up to you. Let me know what your choice would be in the comment section down below. Thank you for watching this video and I will talk to you guys in the next one bass you """
tTxhneVcmEo,Samsung Galaxy Round Review!,6:34,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kay Bhd here and first of all. Yes, there is a ps4 in the house. A lot of people are asking so thumbs up. If you actually want to see me cover that, let me know, but this is a first look at a curved smartphone. This is the Samsung Galaxy round, actually personally a bit more excited for the LG G flex, because that seems way more unique than this Galaxy round is as a product. But there's still a lot of interesting things that we can look at in the first available curved display smartphone. So not any further ado. Let'S go and take a full look. So at first glance, the galaxy round actually doesn't come off as all that crazy of a product. It seems like just your typical Samsung smartphone. In fact it looks like it's older brother, the Galaxy Note 3 quite a bit. It has that same 5.7, inch 1080p AMOLED display on the front the same faux leather stitching on the back, though a slightly different, more brown, leather color, and it really actually shares a lot of the specs and hardware. With the Galaxy Note, 3 like the excellent 13 megapixel camera and the flash, you know what that's exactly what this is a curved display. Galaxy note: 3 I'll, have my full galaxy. Note 3 review right below that like button. If you want a refresher on how awesome that device is, but because this galaxy round is curved, it makes a few trade-offs and it comes back at those with a few bonus features. So here are all the differences between the galaxy round and the galaxy note. 3 number one is the backing. The back of the Galaxy Note. 3 is obviously flat and, of course, has that leatherette stitching pattern. We all know on the back. The back of the galaxy round is a little different when you take it off, it's actually a bit more rigid, more bent into the curved shape of the round to fit the back of the phone. Now, it's obviously still plastic. It'S not some crazy new material or anything like that. It'S very familiar, but it's a little bit more rigid because it's bent into that shape. Now, of course, when you remove the back, you reveal numbers 2. """
Hr8E-_yU2YA,Apple iPad Air Review!,9:00,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kay PhD here - and this is the iPad air - pretty simple, not a whole lot of surprises here, but let's go over what exactly that means. Basically, this is a bigger version of the retina iPad Mini no, I mean. Actually, it is the exact same hardware as the iPad Mini with Retina display same proportions. Same internals, just stretched out into a 10 inch form factor instead of 8 inch. It'S almost like someone huge stomped on the new iPad Mini and flattened it out and boom. You got the iPad air, so what you're? Getting with this is a few new things you get the thin bezels from the iPad Mini you get the flat aluminum unibody back panel in the design you get the beautiful construction from the iPad Mini and you get the extremely reflective Apple logo from the iPad Mini. As well, in fact, it's probably easier to just talk about the ways this is different from the iPad Mini and those would be the size and the battery so in the size department. Obviously this is the biggest change from all the other iPads, which is why they named it. The air when I could have easily named it the iPad 5, but it's the air, because it's just 7.5 millimeters thin and only weighs one pound so for perspective. That'S the same thinness as the iPhone 5s and it weighs way less than any other full-size tablet out there: 30 % less than the all plastic Nexus. 10. That'S really impressive! So that plus the overall new flatter shape of the tablet makes a massive difference in how easy it is to hold. Now I still prefer the soft touch feel of tablets like the Nexus 10 for watching a movie or holding a device up for a long period of time. But this new shape of the air is a huge improvement from the sharp corners of the previous generation iPads, and that's welcome I just for the record. I am NOT the norm, I don't have a normal hand size, but this is actually the first full size iPad that I've been able to hold in one hand, but the truth is that something the iPad keeps doing really well is the build quality and this iPad Air is no exception. It'S beautifully crafted with attention to detail everywhere and it just screams quality at every corner ASIS, if you're still working on the new Nexus, 10 take notes. So you know what I do have to say it, because this is a thing that a surprising number of people are actually concerned about, but the iPad air does have the best camera I have ever used in a tablet like by a lot. It'S a really good front and back facing camera, and that's all I'm gon na say not gon na tell you to use it not going to tell you why it's good or how it forms well, in any situation, I'm just gon na say it takes better quality Photos and videos, I might need to tell you how I figured that out, but look there are some flaws here like there is no touch ID and no fingerprint scanner where I think it could have been most useful on a tablet. I mean how cool would it be for a whole family to share an iPad and they'd all log in with their fingerprints, and they never have to worry about messy user switching. That would be awesome. Oh well. The next iPads will have it most likely, not a big deal. I think my only real gripe with the hardware - that's not actually nitpicking, and I feel, like I say this about every iPad. Is the speakers they're plenty big, loud crisp and clear, but they're all on the same side of the device, the bottom, which means they fire sideways in landscape mode and sideways audio in landscape mode? It drives me insane, especially because I've gotten so used to the Nexus 10's front-facing speakers, but other than that the hardware is great and the software is iOS 7. It feels so conservative I mean after using an iPhone for a bit and now using an iPad. It almost feels really inefficient to use iOS on this larger display. In fact, iPads have the exact opposite problem that Android tablets have right now on an iPad. Everyone'S home screen is basically the same icons and folders, just like the phone home screen, no widgets, no glanceable information, just a blown up phone interface. The Notification Center is just the iPhones Notification Center blown up. The quick controls at the bottom are just the phone's quick toggles blown up. The interface is exactly like the phone, but just spread out more. It seems inefficient. It seems super wasteful, but when you dive into the applications, one of the many hundreds of thousands of optimized applications for the iPad you'll get some of the most impressive functionality. There'S an insane wealth of apps to choose from that are designed specifically for the iPad and the Retina display, and when you open them, you get that entire display size. They take up the whole screen and use multiple columns and gives you tons of information at your fingertips in an entirely different way than they ever would on your phone. This is the opposite for Android tablets on Android tablets. The Play Store is what's lacking. The tablet apps and a surprising amount of apps there are just not optimized for the 10 inch display and the high resolutions and using those apps feels almost wasteful. It seems like you're wasting space, but your home screen is where you can really go to town on the customization. You can add new icon packs and folders and launchers, and there's an insane wealth of widgets and widget customization that you can do to get glanceable information and scrollable power at your fingertips. So I'm waiting for a middle ground and I'll talk more about that in another video, but overall, when you're actually using these applications, the iPad air is a boss performer, it's rocking that Apple a7 chip and that's clocked at 1.4 gigahertz, and it only has one gigabyte Of RAM, but with that iOS style multitasking gets about all you need, and I got to say this makes just about the perfect handheld gaming device. It has a huge battery, so you can gain forever. It has built strong and very, very lightweight, so it's not going to fatigue you to hold it and it has Apple's newest gigantic chip in there, which makes it a great performer and it keeps frame rates high, and it has a huge 9.7 inch 2048 by 1536 Retina display 300 pixels per inch that creates essentially the most immersive gaming experience of any tablet out there. Next to the Nexus 10. When I mentioned the iPad air battery, life is notable, that's because it's great so in a device 7.5 millimeters thin. They managed to cram in 8820 milliamp hour battery and it goes four days on a charge with regular use. I'Ve charged mine exactly three times since I got it more than a week ago and that's what normal really heavy use that I put into devices when I'm testing them and when I use a device. I really push it so. I'Ve had this big, beautiful, Retina display cranked all the way up in brightness and I played games and I browse the web and I played more games and I browsed more and I played even more games and browse even more, and this thing is just it does. Doesn'T quit it does not quit? I actually had to try really hard to burn through the whole thing in a whole day, and I was unsuccessful. I think if I maybe watched a movie on a plane all day, I could do it, but standby time is also incredible on this thing. You don't have to worry about charging it at night, put it to sleep with 60 %, wake up the next morning, 60 %. So basically, the strengths of the iPad air are the performance and the build, and the weaknesses are basically really all in the software department. For me also fun fact: if you want to crash an iPad running, iOS 7 go into the settings and tap brightness and wallpapers twice it crashes every time. I don't know why, but every time without fail, it just happens. So overall, this is a very familiar iPad. Experience, if you know iPad - and you know you like iPad - you know you're going to like the iPad air um. If you had the iPad 1, this is going to make a great upgrade. If you have your iPad 2 you're going to love this iPad air iPad. 3 or iPad 4 you're still going to love this as an upgrade, because it's that much thinner and more importantly, lighter than all the rest of the full-size iPads, and that's why people are going to buy they're, not going to see any sort of crazy interface differences. You'Re not going to see any huge noticeable performance boosts. Everything performs exactly as you would expect, because it's an iPad and that's good and people like that. Overall, though, I really like the iPad air - and I love love the hardware of the iPad air - the display is beautiful. The backing is very light. I just like it: it's not it's nice, it's nice to hold and it's nice to use. It makes me want to use it because of its size, but at the end of the day, I'm not really much of a large tablet person, meaning I don't use large tablets that much. I kind of love my 2013 Nexus 7 and if I had to buy an iPad, I would want a smaller version of the iPad air, which is why the retina iPad Mini is in the mail. And if you want to see a comparison between this and that be sure to leave a thumbs up below, but I do have more content coming for you of the retina iPad Mini.

1dg2UIzIt4s,Google Nexus 5 Review!,15:03,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm KB HD here, and this is the Nexus 5. This is easily one of the most anticipated phones of this whole year and now it's here now, it's official - and this is the full review so start off with the design. So this one comes in black or white and a 16 or 32 gigabyte model. I chose the 32 gig white, I'm calling it the Stormtrooper phone. Others are calling it the panda phone, but I like it. I think the design is pretty classy pretty clean and neat. I did a full video actually on all the differences between the black and white model, so that'll be the first video link right below that like button, but the the only thing I found since that video is that those white Nexus 5 is really not actually pure White, it's actually more of a shale or off-white color to prevent it from getting noticeably dirty very quickly and that works, but the Nexus 5 has a very understated design, like some other Google hardware LG manufactures this guy, but it looks almost nothing like the LG g2 That it's technically based off of as a soft touch finish on the back and it's totally flat like very little curved until you get to the outside edges and then there's a camera bump. But one thing that really strikes you when you're holding the Nexus 5 is just how light it feels in the hand when you first pick it up out the box. It feels unreasonably light, but it's only a hundred and thirty grams so way lighter than the Nexus 4 and the HTC One that's made of metal. It'S actually the same weight as the Galaxy s4, but it still feels more solid in the hand because of that soft touch finish on the back, the rubberized back and although this white one does have some glossy plastic on the sides, but in the words of Matias Duarte, this is hardcore plastic. Now seriously, he actually said that either way the rest of the Nexus 5 design is pretty solid. The buttons are really nice and clicky ER and more tactile than most other phones that screams quality and speaking of quality. Another thing about this phone - that's impressive, is the display and rightfully so it's a 5-inch 1080p display and it's incredibly sharp as you'd expect with 441 pixels per inch and it's an LCD display. So it's super high brightness in daylight, the viewable, a ton of angles and overall, a very accurate pleasing display to the eye. The only possible complaint I could have about this panel are the contrast ratio. Sometimes it looks a little bit washed out and the fact that I could see the LCD panels backlight when holding the phone at an angle. I don't know if I just got to use 2 AMOLED displays that don't have this problem or never realize this, but it became a thing that I just kept noticing. But this is hands-down a big beautiful display. It'S even accented a bit more by the fact that the navigation bar at the bottom and the notification is up top or transparent, so the display really just dominates a big wall on the front of the phone. Also another minor thing I noticed on the white model, the circular earpiece, which is already pretty unique kind of glows a bit and every time I pull the phone out of my pocket, especially outside. I kind of have expected that to be the notification light because it's so bright, but it's not it's just a really bright, constantly glowing white orb in the rest of an otherwise black phone. The actual notification light is multicolored and it's in the bottom center. Just like the Nexus 7's, but I think it would have been awesome if they put the multicolor LED in the earpiece. Oh and the the earpiece on the device and the voice. Quality are actually pretty good, actually really liked that little accent for the earpiece. But, what's not really good, is this speaker? Oh you try to cram the same specs as a high-end $ 700 phone into a 350 dollar phone. You inevitably have to make some sort of shortcut and speaker at the bottom of the Nexus. 5 is definitely one of those shortcuts. It is very, very, very, very, very bad for any smart phone. Not only is it firing out of the bottom of the phone, which means sideways, audio and landscape, but just like the iPhone 5s only the left grille is a speaker and the right grille is just a pretty microphone. So if you accidentally cover just that tiny area with your finger, which I did all the time, you ruin the audio and have to readjust your hand easily. The most disappointing part of the hardware on the whole Nexus 5. Is that speaker now onto something that a lot of other people have been disappointed by in the hardware? Is the camera all right because of a lot of the other high-end internals on this phone? A lot of people are expecting the camera to be high-end as well. It'S not it's not there, one of those shortcuts that LG had to make to get this device to be just $ 350 off contract, so it's definitely a conscious decision they made. In fact, this phone is shares almost all of the same internals as the LG g2, which is much more expensive off contract, but they use a different camera sensor and totally different optics. So this was a conscious decision that they made to go with this sensor. It'S an 8 megapixel sensor behind F, 2.4 glass with optical image stabilization and an LED flash, nothing too extreme here. Here'S the thing: the photos that it takes are average I'd, say better than the Moto X and the Nexus 4, not as good as the Galaxy Note. 3 or Lumia 1020 somewhere in the middle average, the outdoor situations and brightly lit scenarios where you'd expect any camera to do well, it does fine, the shots are decent with sharpness and detail, and the colors are accurate, which is nice. Not every smartphone gets the colors right, but in situations where you'd say you know, hey it'd be nice to get a really sweet shot here and questionable lighting don't count on it. Don'T count on getting a sweet shot out of the Nexus 5 because it isn't happening. It'S just not that high-end a sensor and it's not up to that task, no shot that you get from the Nexus 5 is going to blow anyone out of the water and make them think. Oh wow, you took that with a phone. No way I mean it. Does fine and the shots that you take are good enough to share on Twitter and really anywhere on the web, but, like we said this isn't going to match the $ 700 high-end smartphone cameras? Naturally it actually does its best. It really shines in low-light, no pun intended. Okay, that was totally intended, but low-light is one of its strongest points thanks to the optical image stabilization. In fact, I'd say this. Nexus 5 takes some of the best low-light shots of any smartphone next to the HTC. One of a full gallery of all my sample shots linked in the description below. If you want to check out any of those, I think a lot of the reason people aren't as happy with the Nexus 5 camera experience is because it's not fast anymore. It used to be really fast. If you remember, when the Galaxy Nexus was introduced, had instant shutter, you could just fire off photos. Rapid fire and instant shutter would take care of that, for you really fast, the Nexus 5, as far as I can tell it. Just doesn't have it anymore, there's no instant shutter in this new camera. App and cameras have always been the weakest point of Nexus devices, and this is no exception. The software is pretty slow to open up the camera app and then once the camera app is open. It'S pretty slow to actually take the photo once you've pressed the shutter button a lot of times you want to get HDR mode on and that particular mode takes us a full second or two actually turn on and then actually taking. Hdr photo also takes a full. Second, or so before it processes and you're already ready to take the next shot so in between shot time is really long. The first time you take a shot, it takes a while to open up the camera and it takes a while to switch between modes. So I would characterize this as a slow camera and that doesn't give anyone any sort of confidence when taking shots with it. I mentioned in another review video of a recent phone, the Moto X, where the camera was just awful as well. This is on a very very software level. This could be entirely fixed through a software update. I would encourage Google to push the stock camera after the Play Store, like Motorola, did with theirs and make it better through that, because this is really the worst part of the software. This phone, this camera app, could use a lot of work, but at least something that I loved about the Nexus 5's camera app is the video mode. The optical image stabilization makes for some really smooth video, which is awesome. Focusing is pretty quick. You can take pictures while recording and the microphone is really good, as you can probably hear it's easily one of the best in any smartphone I've ever used and that's LG's fault, so good job LG. I appreciate the awesome mic and the video quality is that much better because of it, but of course this is the Nexus device. So the main focus here, let's be honest, really isn't the hardware, it's most definitely the software and of course this is running. The latest version of brand new Android 4.4 KitKat. In fact it's the only device right now on the market running KitKat, and the word I would use to describe KitKat on this phone is clean. That'S the word that keeps coming to mind when looking at this new design. In fact, it feels like a very understated minimal OS for a very clean, minimal understated phone design. First thing: you'll notice is the transparency and they've removed a lot of the holo blue accents from jellybean and made those elements pure white. So there's no crazy, colors going on here anymore for the most part, except for that Settings app, which apparently, they forgot to remove the blue from. But the real point here of the new design is to let the apps take center stage. Let the Play stores take center stage and apps are now the main focus. Even their icons are bigger and as a newly adjusted Roboto font and even this further supported immersion mode, which will encourage apps to take up the full screen and hide the notification bar and the navigation bar now KitKat is way less memory hungry than previous versions of Android, in fact, it lowered the system requirements to half a gig of ram. So that's not a problem for the Nexus 5 plus. The Nexus 5 has a Snapdragon, 800, 2.3 gigahertz, quad-core, processor and 2 gigabytes of RAM, so performance here is exactly as you would expect. It'S buttery, it's very responsive and smooth and silky, and whatever other words you want to use to describe the feeling of using stock Android on a high-end device. It'S all of that, and that goes for multitasking and switching between open apps and for launching new apps. And this goes for web browsing and scrolling around in Chrome. It'S all very familiar stuff, like the Google Play edition galaxy s4 and the Google Play edition HTC One. It performs just like those which is great and since jellybean supports trim. An newest version of android supports trim as well long story short here is this phone is likely going to perform really well just like this for years to come, but even after knowing all that, you know it's weird the battery life, I'm surprised by how inconsistent that Battery life really was with this Nexus 5. Now it has a Snapdragon 800 chip and that's supposed to be a power. Sipper and Android 4.4 is supposed to be less memory. Intensive and there's supposed to be. You know new location settings in Android 4.4 to use even less battery an optimization on a Nexus device should be at an all-time high and has a modest-sized 2300 million power battery, but yet actually could not make it through an entire day on the Nexus 5 battery. Without recharging at some point during the day still haven't done it, and that sucks I mean I get up at 7 a.m. and at some point before maybe 5 p.m. the battery will be dead and I have to get it onto a charger now. It helps that this supports wireless charging, so I can just drop it on an orb anywhere and it helps that it's actually a quick charger, because it's only a 2300 million power battery. But still I wish the battery was better. The phone is very slim. It'S it's one of the thinnest out there and it's already extremely light. I would not have a problem at all if LG had put a larger battery inside and made it a little bit thicker bigger phones, even the curved phones out there right now tend to be a little bit easier to hold from the flat thin ones, and this Is a flat fin phone and I would have rather seen a slightly bigger and maybe more curved phone with a bigger battery just to get it through the day, at least once now, as technically a developer device. I don't even know how much Google would care about the battery life, the camera and the speaker on the Nexus 5, but at least two out of these three things could potentially be fixed with an update to Android straight from Google and it's a nexus. So you will get that update fast and I love KitKat already it's the most advanced version of Android, yet it's the most beautiful version of Android yet, and that makes using the phone an absolute pleasure and I use my phone all the time, I'm basically a power User, I could say, and if I could find a way to get more than what seems like the maximum of three hours of screen on time in one charge. I would be super happy with this phone, but even now I am definitely satisfied and I'm moderately happy using what I think is a really sharp eye catching device and the best version of Android out there KitKat. It also has one of the smallest learning curves of any versions of Android. There is more visual cues starting right on the lockscreen, where they have an up arrow for Google now and an actual camera icon, like iOS 7. That tells you that you can swipe to get into the camera, it's an even better thought-out operating system, and you can see much more attention to detail and a lot of places, even if they did forget to take out the holo blue from the settings there are. So also all kinds of little little things in android 4.4 that you notice after a while they're like hey. Why does it do that? You know little quirks like in the hangouts SMS integration. It has a separate thread for your hangouts and your SMS from the same person I feel like it should recognize names and combine those there's also two photo apps and Android 4.4, not really sure why, if they're planning on merging them or not, I don't know they're, Just kind of there so there's little things like that, but you'll probably end up seeing all the biggest problems with it fixed in software updates and like 4.4.1, very soon, which you will be seeing immediately if you have a nexus 5. So the bottom line is this: Nexus 5. Is the most Google phone? That'S ever been made it's it's. Some people like to call it pure Android and as far as we can tell it still is, but it feels like a Google experienced Android, whereas you also have the Samsung experience, Android and HTC, and the Sony experience Android. This feels like the Google version of Android, which a lot of people will like if you're looking for a high-end device, with no compromises and all the best specs and on paper, statistics and numbers, and things like that. The Nexus 5 is just flat out. Not for you you'd be better off with something like the HTC One or the Galaxy Note 3 or the Lumia 1020, or something like that. But if you're looking for the most pure google experience - and you want to be first in line for android updates - and you want to have all the same things - that the other Nexus is have plus a little bit because it's a Nexus 5. Well then, this is the phone for you buy it the Nexus 5. When you don't consider, the price is great. The Nexus 5, when you do consider the price is in a league of its own, because there really isn't any other $ 350 phone with a Snapdragon 800 and the latest version of Android. There just isn't another phone like that for $ 350. So it's in a sort of a class of its own, which is why a lot of people have a hard time deciding what to compare it with. It inevitably gets compared with other $ 700 phones, rather than other $ 350 phones. I think Google could decide to make a $ 700 nexus and not make any compromises like the camera and the speaker, but right now this is the Nexus 5 we have and it's recommended for a certain group of people and, if you're considering buying it you're, probably In that group of people you know who you are, and I wouldn't hesitate. I would just pick one out anyway. This is Ben mkbhd. Thank you for watching. If you enjoyed this, video review of the Nexus 5 be sure to share it and, of course, there's a subscribe button below.

P4Hbn6xcD9M,Samsung Galaxy Gear Review!,10:14,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm KB HD here and it's the end of 2013 and now smartwatches are becoming a thing. So this one here is the Samsung Galaxy gear. It'S the first SmartWatch from Samsung, and it's probably that SmartWatch II saw on some commercials somewhere, but it was a pretty good commercial, but the first generation of a product you see out of a company is usually the one you want to pay the most attention to, Especially the first product in a new product category like smartwatches, so this is the one we're going to put under the microscope. First, let's take a full detailed look at the Samsung Galaxy gear. At first glance, the Galaxy gear appears to be just slightly different from your normal watch, but Samsung is calling it the next big thing. So this is their first in wearable tech and they've decided to put it on your wrist as an accessory to your phone and it'll connect via bluetooth. So as a watch, this is actually quite well built. It'S a solid, rigid plastic band all the way around and a pretty nice clasp design, that's adjustable to fit even the most extreme wrist sizes like mine and the watch part itself is actually pretty compact. It doesn't stand out or look as ridiculous, as you might think. The only button on the entire device is the power button on the right hand, side which can be programmed to do certain things when you double tap it, but a single tap will turn the display on or off and surrounding the whole face of the watch is Surprise, metal, real metal from Samsung, so that's good news and of course, on the actual face of the watch. Instead of the regular analog mechanics, it is a 1.6 inch 320 by 320, oh le D display - and it's actually objectively very nice. It has a 275 PPI pixel density and great bright vivid colors and as an outdoor mode for enhanced brightness. So you can see it everywhere and excellent viewing angles. So you can see it indoors outdoors pretty much whenever you want it's really nice display on the back. You have these pins, which you'll need to connect to the dock for the Galaxy gear, which is actually necessary. It comes in the box and you need it for the NFC pairing set up for the first time and for every time you char. So, every time you want to charge your Galaxy gear, you have to hook it up to this clasp and dock, which has that lovely, faux leather stitching that we love so much and then you'll plug it. In now on the bottom of the watch, there's another metal piece that sits below your wrist and unfortunately this is the only part of the watch that feels a bit bulky and like actually sometimes gets in the way. So when I'm resting my wrist on something or trying to type it kind of, gets annoying, but there's a reason for this metal piece here there are actually more electronics in there. If you hold it up to the light, you can actually see the electronics wiring going down into the metal. Clasp turns out this metal clasp contains the speakerphone. Yes, that's a speakerphone in the bottom, so you don't actually have to hold the watch up to your face. Like a weirdo to talk on the phone, you can just talk and it'll hear you, but you do have to hold it like a total weirdo. However, if you want to take pictures with it like this, because that's a camera yeah the bulge on the galaxy gear is a camera arm questionable choice of a feature to add on a watch but hey it's there, it's a two megapixel sensor and it can take Square photos that actually you know they look half decent for a watch, and the year can also record up to 15 seconds of 720p video and I've noticed that the microphone quality, since it's meant to be meant for phone calls and a speakerphone. It'S pretty good. You can get an idea of the video quality here. It'S definitely not bad, but at its heart this is an Android device, Android 4.2 to be specific, and sometimes it's really obvious but other times, not so much, thanks of course to Samsung's skin that they've overlaid on here. That shows one app per page, but it's powered by a single core: 800 megahertz processor, half a gig of ram, and it even has four gigs of internal storage and it's back in a 315 milliamp hour battery. To put that into perspective. This watch actually has very similar computing power to the original Motorola Droid back in the day, which was a very sizable device, but it has a battery way less than a quarter of the size, and because of that, it can only really promise you one full day Of actual use - and you might be able to eat two days out of it, if you really don't use it all that much standby time is great, but at the end of the day you're going to have to charge it every single night and as a watch Person, that's usually something people don't have to do with a watch. So it's a really big annoyance if you're used to well only charging one two every night instead of two, but really, though, what can the Galaxy gear do? That'S the number one question people have about it when they see it well: okay, number one: it can give you notifications from your phone they're pretty useless, though, because they don't actually tell you anything. They just tell you that you have a notification on your phone, which means you have to go check your phone anyway, and it's kind of pointless, it's better with some built-in samsung apps like the Samsung Mail, app and Samsung stock messenger. But not everyone really uses those. Next up there is s voice to give you commands to your phone, which should, in theory, let you call people and text people from your wrist, but s voice is still s voice and the speech recognition is a bit shoddy and it doesn't always work all the Time you can take voice, memos and save them to your phone, which is nice, and you also have the gallery which lets you take. Pictures and transfer them to your Samsung phone or even share them directly from supported apps in the Samsung store which we'll get to in a second there's a MIDI controller, which is actually very useful. It allows you to control the volume and media playback in, like any media app like YouTube, Spotify SoundCloud whatever, so you can control your music while keeping your phone in your pocket and then there is a pedometer to keep track of your fitness and distance traveled and Calories burned. I can also talk to the s health app on your Samsung phone, so wearable tech right now really seems to be specializing in Fitness, which can be really cool. Also side. Note the pedometer isn't very accurate. I mean it's on your wrist, so you can walk with your hands in your pockets and they'll somewhat sync up. But if you don't, then this is a step and this is a step and this is a step and I'm walking what and then there's the contacts. The call log and the dialer, so you can place and receive calls on the speakerphone on your watch on your wrist, which is what Samsung has really been harping up in their commercials, and I got to say this feature works perfectly. It basically turns your phone into a Bluetooth. Speaker might not be the coolest thing in public when everyone can hear your phone call, but when the phone is in another room and maybe bluetooth is still connected, you can pick up an incoming call without running to go. Find your phone and lastly, there is a mini, app store that Samsung has kick-started for the Galaxy gear and the list of apps in that app store is definitely not very large and there aren't even that many categories. But then again it's a watch and hey. There are some nice apps in there. There are some interesting somewhat usefully functional apps like the watchface applications. I really like them, because they, let me actually mess around with the Galaxy gears watch face in real time. So that's nice, but the rest of you are basically miniaturized versions of bigger titles like Evernote or snapchat, and there are some pretty big gaps that should obviously be filled later. This is literally a brand new app store, so it doesn't take any sort of cues from Google Play at all, but that's something developers are going to have to fill in the apps, I'm finding and liking for the Galaxy gear are mostly oh. Why didn't I think of that ideas like stuff like that, could really seem like a SmartWatch is worth getting, but just because you can't do it on any other form factor doesn't mean you actually need to right now. It seems like a case of Google glass, where the app store doesn't immediately matter. It'S more just about warming people up to the core functionality of a device with this new form factor and then letting the App Store grow and seeing what developers can do with it. Now, up to this point, you may have realized hey. This is all being done through a Samsung app on a Samsung device and you'd be totally right. This is actually only compatible with a Samsung Android device running Android 4.3 or later, and there are only two of those right now. The Galaxy Note 3 and the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet and soon the galaxy s4 and the galaxy note 2. But it's a very small portion of all the devices out there and that is easily the galaxy gears biggest limitation and biggest fault or problem at this point, and it even looks worse when you compare it to its natural competitor, which would be the pebble smartwatch right Now, which is compatible with just about any SmartWatch that has bluetooth, so the biggest limitation to the Galaxy gear right now physically, is the compatibility. So, at the end of the day, the Galaxy gear is definitely a very polarizing and somewhat confusing device. Just because it's unclear who exactly was going to buy something like this, because when you consider the watch enthusiasts already, who already all have watches they're not going to spend $ 300 on something. That'S like this. But if you consider the tech enthusiasts, who always use their phones, why would they put something on their wrist? So if you're on the fence about buying something like this, I would say at least wait for the price to drop, because it will mark my words. But if you want to keep waiting the galaxy gear 2 is probably going to be a better option or you could away from the other SmartWatch manufacturers, because Google is probably going to come out with one Apple, probably going to come out with one Sony's, probably going To come out with one and many many more so there's definitely some future things to look forward to, but since Tam, so I'm good at first. This is what they can call their pioneer and they can take all the credit for being the first one in the market with it, but I can't really recommend it for everyone. I can only really recommend it for someone who just has to have it as a sort of a companion or accessory to your Galaxy phone. So this is a good entry, it's a good beginning and it's a good start and a good sign for the future of smartwatches, and it's definitely got me excited for what we're going to see when Google takes a stab at it, and many more companies get their Game on with a SmartWatch and other wearable tech, either way, that's been it.

hUgOgMCKXqs,Sony Xperia Z1 Review!,9:06,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kip EHD here - and this is the Sony Xperia z1 or z2 p Paul it it's. Basically, it tuned up and refined. Xperia Z surprised alright. So it is a major step up on the inside from the Xperia Z flagship and we'll get to that in a second, but on the outside. It is more of an incremental upgrade with some minor tweaks here and there and improvements to the design and the overall way it feels in the hands. So the whole actual outside of the Xperia z1 is reinforced metal. With this black plastic band on the inside, which is good because it's not the other way around now the buttons on the side of the phone, I think, are really well placed, especially for smaller hands they're on the right spots and with the typical Sony full edge-to-edge Glass on the front and the back of the phone, it does have two effects: one. It makes the phone feel super premium and high-end in the hand expensive. Even it's actually heavier but number two. It makes the phone feel actually a little bit more delicate. The metal doesn't quite wrap around to the front or the back. So if you drop this phone on either of its faces, it will hit glass. So I kind of got these mixed feelings. Holding in the hand, it doesn't feel bad by any means, but just like the Nexus 4 and the iPhone, it naturally made me more careful not to drop it. So a lot of people are going to love the look of and just a pure aesthetics of the Xperia z1 and that's great because it's a really good-looking phone. But to me it still has the same problem as the original Xperia Z, where it doesn't really know. If it wants to be a ruggedized device or not it's a great-looking device in the first place, but then you add the fact that it's IP 58 certified. So that means it's dust proof it's water resistant for up to one meter deep for up to thirty minutes. So, in order to do that, it has to add a whole bunch of these different things where it needs to cover up all the different ports. It has to have almost no openings. The speaker has to be significantly worse. It has this permanent screen protector on that you cannot remove and a whole bunch of other things that are all sealed up about the phone to make it IP 58 certified. But does anyone really need that in a phone and at the end of the day, it's glass on the front in the back and it's not exactly the most rugged thing in the world? I feel like if this device was not, I be 58 certified and if they didn't cover every single port with flaps and if they didn't worry about the display being certified and had it open speaker and just had a a much more traditional built device. It would be a lot more appealing to me, but all the stuff is no different than the Xperia Z and neither is the power button that feels a little bit mushy or the completely awful speaker on the bottom. All these are sacrifices that Sony's made to get this beautiful device to survive some rain or some mud or being dropped in the shallow end of a pool or something like that. The worst of it is actually the SIM card tray. It'S an absolute disaster to get the SIM card into the flexible plastic tray thing and then into the phone and taking it out is even worse. So thankfully most people will only have to do that one time, but there are also some nice subtle things that have changed on the good end. Like the notification LED inside the earpiece is probably the prettiest on a phone next to the lg, optimus G and you'd. Probably never know if no one told you, but there is a permanent screen protector on the glass that you'd probably never see if you weren't looking for it and speaking of that display it's a completely similar story to the Xperia Z. It'S rocking a 5-inch 1920 by 1080 panel, which brings it to 441 pixels per inch. Super sharp, with bright, vibrant colors and relatively contrast II. Pleasing images until you turn it off axis, that's where it falls apart because of the protector that they put on the display to help it pass that IP 58 certification, the Xperia z1, has some pretty poor viewing angles when it comes to color reproduction. You can see here compared to the Moto X that it starts getting weird at only about 30 degrees off-axis and by then it just looks totally washed out and you're missing all the color and contrast, as you know, the rest of the quirks about this phone. Like the flaps that you have to open to charge it and a glass front and back and the new design they're all things that you can get used to after just a little bit of use, but this display this display was the one thing that I could Never get over because it's the one thing that you have to look at when you're using your phone and a lot of people argue you'll, never use the display off axis, but trying to show just one other person, some movie or something on your phone you'll have To deal with these incredibly poor viewing angles, even when gaming, when you turn the phone a lot you're gon na, have to deal with this. But there's another hardware feature that we can talk about. That'S gotten a lot of attention on the z1, and that is the camera, and it's a pretty good one. Now a lot of people automatically look at that 20 megapixels and assume whoa must be in the top five smartphone cameras. Now it's actually not, but don't get me wrong. It'S not bad at all. It'S like number six, but it has its pros and cons. But first I want to say that this phone has just about the perfect button layout for taking pictures like a mouse. So, anyway, opening up the camera app from any shortcut for single notices. The viewfinder frame rate is very high and it takes you into Sony's superior, auto mode by default, which is supposed to choose the best photo mode to use by evaluating the situation. But it turns your image size down to eight megapixels and turns the image stabilization off by default, which is weird so I was getting a habit of switching to manual mode and turning into 20 megapixels and turning the software stabilization on now. The phone's camera actually has a pretty big sensor, bigger than the one in the galaxy s4 and in the iPhone. So if you want to take that for granted, it does give you a nice shallow depth of field. It also has a benefit of Sony optics and Sony, like we know, makes great cameras, so that should be all good there, but the images were decent at best they're, not gon na shock. Anyone that you took them from a camera phone or anything mostly because the image processing is meh and the colors really aren't that vibrant. They sometimes look a bit dull, but the sharpness is definitely there and the focus was pretty accurate in regular light. So they tend to look alright. The camera really struggled, though in low-light I have to mention that the very colors and the artifacts and the noise patterns and low-light were just really bad. The flash didn't help either so there's no real optical image stabilization. So it's really not that good in low-light but lucky for us. Sony has put a lot of effort into the Xperia skin, and the camera is one place where you can really see a lot of it in action. The manual mode has that exposure control dial. So you can choose how to meter the image manually, which is nice and again it's in that sweet spot with the awesome button layout. I really like shooting with it future software updates, in addition to the one that the phone's already received, can probably work on processing and images a bit better though, but as of right now, the camera is just pretty good, not the greatest, as a lot of people Expected it to be, but I have a full sample image gallery linked right below that like button. If you want to check all those out now, the rest of Sony's Xperia skin is very familiar if you've used any other Sony phone, and it's obvious that Sony is putting a lot of effort into improving this and making it a better usage experience. It'S running here on top Android 4.2 jelly bean, and since this phone is rockin, a Snapdragon 800 processor. Yes, it is a great performer, like it crushes through benchmarks, browses the web super smooth and very fast and is just all-around rarely stutters at all, like you would expect from a Snapdragon 800 device and as responsive as this software is they've really added a lot of Stuff one example to take advantage of the larger display is the smaller windowed apps that we've seen on other big screen phones. They come from the multitasking menu here and there's only a few of them, but it's a step in the right direction and hopefully other apps will be able to plug into this in the future and there's also the menu dedicated to power saving at Sony's added in It seems that they were very concerned with battery life when they made this phone. The Xperia z1 has a sealed in 3000 milliamp hour battery already, so it lasted all day with regular to heavy use, but even more impressive was the standby time. It actually is. One of the better standby times of any Android device I've used, so that's thanks to all the modes that automatically kick in when you're, not using it for a while and the rest of the using the phone is exactly as you would expect. Really I mean I haven't, found any app that it can't handle or any games that it can't run smoothly its overall a buttery experience. I'M just hoping Sony keeps their finger on the pulse here and updates this device to Android 4.4 when it comes out, because I think there's gon na be some interesting Google experience stuff that skin phone users are really gon na like so. At the end of the day, the Xperia z1 is exactly what it sounds like it's: a sort of a refined tuned up, more bold Xperia Z, which is great because if you really like the original Xperia Z, you're gon na love, the Xperia z1. But if you're in the same boat as me, where you didn't like the Xperia Z, some software wasn't really for me. I didn't like the way it looked as much then you're, probably not gon na, like the Xperia z1, either because they're very similar in that regard. But either way, that's why the comments section is open. Let us know what you think of the Xperia z1 right down there below and you'll.

uBEaG6n0XDs,Apple iPhone 5s Review!,13:32,"Okay, hey: what is up guys, I'm Kay Bhd here - and this is not the first iPhone 5s review and it probably won't be the last, but sometimes when you use the device for a while longer than the typical review period for tech reviewers, you get a little Bit of a better sense of what you like the device for and what you don't like it for and just a little tidbits and quirks about it and overall, a general idea of how well you like to use it and that's exactly what this video is about. This is an iPhone 5s review from the perspective of a person who uses a lot of Google services. I'Ve done videos about iOS before this is my first iPhone review. Believe it or not. This took me like seven iPhones to actually do a review of it, but without any further ado, let's get right on into this, so this is the iPhone 5s in Space Gray. It comes in three colors, but this is the one I personally thought was my favorite. It'S just as familiar as the rest of the iPhones out there it's running iOS 7. It has that familiar array of icons like every other iPhone, and it's just as small. In fact, let me start by saying that, yes, I'm aware that the iPhone looks very small in my hands. That'S because it is small in my hands the Samsung Galaxy. Note 3 is a phone I've carried for a while now and it feels pretty natural for me to hold, but it's a bigger than average phone for most people and it has a 5.7 inch display. But to me it doesn't feel all that extreme, but a smaller, more common option that you'll probably see more frequently is the samsung galaxy s4. This is a pretty popular phone and it has a 5-inch display and has that same general. Look to it. As a Galaxy Note, 3, but it takes up less space and involves reaching to the corners of it less, but even smaller than that is the Moto X. This is one of my favorite devices right now and it's very compact. It stuffs a 4.7 inch display into a body, that's not that much bigger than the iPhone. So I can grip the whole thing, but even this phone starts to look big when you compare it to the iPhone 5s. This phone has a 4-inch display, so it's easily the smallest of the displays on any flagship by any company right now, but it's also one of the most compact mobile devices period, which is something that Apple's really proud of in this phone, and I don't blame them. The device is really light, really easy to hold, and people can reach all four corners of the display with one hand, although I think people could do that on a four and a half inch display too, but this is also one of the most fragile feeling. Phones out there, it's not actually fragile. It'S really extremely well built. It'S made out of premium materials like the HTC one. It'S got metal in there, it's very tightly put together, there's no creaking or any twisting or anything like that, but the lack of any curves plus the glass on the back, like the Nexus 4, make it feel like. I better not drop this device like if I drop it from a few inches up. It feels like it's very delicate and vulnerable to scratches, like I should be putting a case on it or something. Now there are a couple of things about the battery in this device. It'S like, we said a 1570 milliamp hour battery and that measurement is pretty small. In fact, this entire iPhone is about the same size as a galaxy note 3 battery, which is over 3000 milliamp hours. So, with this, having half the battery sizes and Note 3 has its pros and has its cons. One of the important pros is that it charges very quickly, I'd like to say it charges lightning fast, but the cons are immediately that the battery doesn't last quite as long as any other smartphone out there with a larger battery now standby times are excellent on the Iphone, I could go to sleep with an iPhone at 100 % battery not charge it, and it would wake up with 97 % battery. That'S pretty good. An Android device with a similar sized battery might be at 80 % when you wake up. So that's pretty good. That iOS takes good advantage of what it thinks you should be closing in the background when you're sleeping, but it doesn't have the best battery life during actual use. In fact, it's not even quite as good as the iPhone 5 I'd say. Maybe 5 percent worse than the iPhone 5, but it's it's about the same battery life as you'd expect from an iPhone. So if you're coming from a previous generation iPhone, you won't find too many surprises here with the battery life. Everything else about the hardware, though, is very well crafted. We saw this in the iPhone 5. It'S solid aluminum on the sides in the back. It has awesome buttons that are precisely crafted so that they don't wobble at all, which is nice plus they have the laser etchings to indicate volume up and down. The chamfered edges are angled ever so slightly inwards. The headphone jack and the Lightning port are on the bottom, with the precisely milled speaker grille holes. I mean, I don't think it's it's it's just about how all this is in such a small package. That makes it a little difficult to appreciate, which is why I think HTC one still feels just as good in the hand. Now. The speakers on the bottom of the iPhone are one of the more interesting parts of it. I expected them to be really good but check this out. There are two speaker grilles at the bottom of the iPhone that looks great, looks like stereo speakers, but it's actually just a single driver on the right-hand side sort of echoes over to the left-hand side. So if you cover up the left-hand side, you will hear no change in the sound. If you cover up the right-hand side where the driver is, you can completely mute the speakers, so you have to be sure not to do that by accident. I'Ll give you a sample of a sound, completely muted. Well anyway, like we've said, the iPhone has obviously familiar Hardware on the outside, but what about the inside? Because that's where the main change came from between the 5 and the 5s? Now, if you thought the Moto X was a consumer-oriented device that didn't care about specs and targeted the average consumer, wait till you see the spec sheet of the iPhone 5s. It has on paper the same specs as literally not even exaggerating, a flagship from 2011 meet. The Samsung Galaxy s2 release date April 2011 inside it had a dual-core 1.2 gigahertz chip, 1 gigabyte of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage, an 8 megapixel camera and a 1650 milliamp hour battery now meet the iPhone 5s release date a couple weeks ago. It has a dual-core 1.3 gigahertz chip, 1 gigabyte of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage and 8 megapixel camera and a 1570 milliamp hour battery. So this is where Apple does its absolute best to make sure specs, don't matter nearly as much as I used to they control the entire experience from the hardware to the software and there's a lot of optimization going on and in the end performance throughout iOS 7. Is pretty snappy? It performs on par with just about every other flagship today that has an 8 core chip and double the RAM and 20 megapixel cameras and iOS, as we know, never really required all that much resources to run smoothly and multitask well and not eat through battery life. Like a hungry wolf through steak, so it's not really surprised that the iPhone 5s is quite fast, especially when compared to older iPhones. But how is IO s7 well for me actually like the look of ios7 at least a lot of it, but its functionality is still exactly the same as iOS 6. It'S essentially a layer of gloss over the top. A visual overhaul, if you will the motto here, is you'll, probably like it or learn to like it. But if you don't too bad, because you just can't change things, you still can't customize a lot of the things that I'm used to being able to customize out-of-the-box on something like an Android phone in iOS, 7 you'll, probably like most of the new icons. But if you don't like one or two or several too bad, you might like the new keyboard. But if you don't too bad, you might love the new stock lockscreen or the new dialer or all the new stock applications. But if you don't too bad, my biggest gripe with iOS 7 was actually the animation. So every time I unlock the iPhone 5s there was this new animation in iOS 7. That takes a solid half a second before it lets me, do anything on the home screen, and I don't like that at all and that's too bad. So now anytime, I want to unlock the phone and I already know I want to go to the second page of apps. I have to wait for the animation to finish before I can do anything because wall is animating its unresponsive on the touchscreen still bugs me to this day. I wish I could change the animation speed, just speed it up a little bit. There'S also a lot of weird little bits of fragmentation like with the keyboard, for example, where, if the app you're using isn't updated for iOS 7, it doesn't get to use Apple's new keyboard goodies. The old iOS 7 looking keyboard, which creates a bit of visual inconsistency and that will, I guess, be a bit of a mess until app developers get on the case and update their apps for the new OS. But overall yeah. I, like the look of a lot of iOS 7. I think it's quite nice in a lot of areas that aren't the icons on the home screen, but the functionality I still have problems with and those still remain, and that's too bad now outside of this. Of course, iOS is still a great choice for a lot of people and that obviously won't change. I mean 10 million people bought this phone the first weekend. It was available, so it's clear that people love it and want it as a Google service user with stuff. You know like Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar tasks, etc. You can get most of the core stuff. You need and get away with it from the app store. So the situation is really not that bad at all, and then there are of course, the few fringe benefits of the iPhone like touch ID, for example, which is the name for the fancy fingerprint sensor in the home button of the iPhone lets. You unlock your phone or vente Kate, your iTunes purchases, and you can register up to ten fingers. Of course, people have also found great ways to register things other than fingers like their toes their pets, toes and even other body parts, but uh. It'S a cool feature. It works pretty well pretty accurately. Most of the time just note that every time you restart your phone you'll have to re-enter your whole iTunes password before using touch ID and app store again. Another thing: that's great about the iPhone. Is the camera experience? The camera experience in my opinion is made up of two different parts: it's the quality and the control and there's a little bit of the scale. I'D say between one and ten for quality and between one and ten for control. A lot of devices that have ten out of ten for quality like the Lumia 1020, for example. You can't just give it to a random person on the street and ask them to take a great photo with it. They'Ll probably have a little bit of difficulty, but if you get a really really easy to use camera chances, are it's not going to take great photos, so the iPhone strikes a nice balance because, on the scale of one to ten for quality, it's around an eight And on the scale of one to ten for control, it's pretty simple, but it's an easy to use app. So that's another eight out of ten, and I think that is what makes it a very likable camera. You can just open it with a swipe up from the shortcut in the corner and immediately begin to take pictures so characterize the camera on the back of the iPhone 5s as a very fast camera and a bunch of different ways fast number one, because it's very Fast to take photos and to process shots, that's number two, because taking HDR's is very quick, so you don't have to have it necessarily still subject fast number three, because the aperture itself is very fast is wide open. I believe it's F, 2.0 or 2.2, which can be a little bit softer than the iPhone five, but still is plenty fast and great for low-light and again fast because of the video modes in here, you can take really really fast 120 frames per second video and Then slow it down to 30 frames per second to get this awesome smooth slow-motion effect, so this is a very fast camera. What I most enjoyed about shooting with the 5s is camera, though, was the low-light capabilities. The thing can essentially see in the dark where a lot of the other camera phones - I've used, fall short, but you can see all the test shots that I took in the full imager link in the description right below that like button where I'll you see, you Know, low-light shots and regular light shots and usually get the photos it takes, are really pretty solid. The colors were very accurate, like extremely colorful and created the detail was pretty much all there. It was only a little bit softer than the iPhone 5 because of the wider aperture, but overall the shots you get out of this thing are very good. Overall, though, in terms of the quality of photos and videos you get and the control you have over them, this is up there in some of the best smartphones you can get to take photos with so yeah using the iPhone 5s is just as you would expect. You get great performance, smooth animations throughout you, get that super compact form factor and excellent, build quality and design and material choices, and you get the usual quirks with a relatively new operating system, but those will either iron out or we will get used to them. You get that future-proof ness with the new 64-bit architecture, apple's new chip and apple having control over the whole OS and ecosystem and have a very reliable device that almost always works exactly as you'd expect it to. Even if you don't like the way it does something you can be confident that it'll do it that way, every single time until you get used to it, it's a very familiar device for a lot of people and probably isn't worth rushing to upgrade to if you're Coming from an iPhone 5, but from any other older iPhone, it's a great choice for all it's worth. So at the end of the day, there are some things that are really liked about the iPhone and some things that I really don't like. Obviously, about the iPhone that a lot of other people will probably agree with the display is one of the most polarizing things to me. I love the quality of the display. I just wish it was bigger and there are a lot of things that I like about. The build it's a beautifully crafted device, it's just a little bit too small and feels a little bit fragile, even though, is in fact really sturdy, no creaking or bending at all. So there are some polarizing things about it. At the end of the day, though, I'm not a big is user. If you want to see a full, dedicated, iOS review or sort of a video on just me and iOS, who free to leave a comment below or a thumbs up, if you want to see something like that, but either way this has been it. This is the iPhone 5s in space grey. Thank you for watching the review and I'll talk to you guys in the next video you """
9NSBB-kFDGQ,Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Review!,12:32,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm KB HD here - and this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 successor to the galaxy note 2 and older brother of the samsung galaxy s4, and this is a phone that takes a little bit from both to combine into a really unique Interesting Samsung flagship device, so first things first. Yes, this is a large device. It has a 5.7 inch 1920 by 1080 AMOLED display, but it's packed into a body. That'S both thinner, lighter and narrower than the galaxy note. 2. It fits in its footprint and it has a larger battery. So when you consider all that this one is actually more compact than its predecessor, but nevertheless it's a bigger than average phone, and that makes it a two handed device for most people. But if you take a step back and look at it, this is a pretty interesting phone aesthetically. The front is the typical Samsung squared-off. Look like the Galaxy s4 has we're used to it, plus the home button in the middle on the front that Samsung loves. So much all around the sides, there's this silver metal band that wraps all the way around and has the buttons. So your power button and volume button. I feel like they're a little bit high up on the chassis. I don't think that people with smaller hands are gon na, like that it makes you reach a little bit more, but then again, you'll, probably never press them accidentally and up top you have your headphone jack, your microphone and the IR blaster and out. The bottom is a smaller weaker speaker and the USB 3.0 port that I'll get to in a second, it has a removable back, which reveals the gigantic 3200 million power battery one of the biggest and longest lasting in any phone right now, in fact, it's about the Same size as the iPhones display by itself, and you can see the camera and flash module, the SIM card and SD card readers and the stylus on the left hand, side. The backing has an extremely subtle curve on the edge to the center of the back. So that it doesn't rock on a table and you set it down, but it feels pretty good when you're holding it in your hand. Oh and a lot of people have been quick to judge the way. This phone looks because it looks like leather and a lot of people want to get their hands on other phone, but this is not leather. This is plastic. That'S shaped to look like it feels like leather, but it doesn't even actually feel like leather. It feels like plastic, because it's plastic so now that we're not fooled by the aesthetic into thinking this phone is crazy, well-built, what's the deal with this USB 3.0? Basically, this is the first smartphone to have a USB 3.0 port at the bottom. This allows for faster charging with Samsung's, cable and much faster data transfer speeds if your computer supports USB 3.0. But if you lose that super ugly charger, don't worry, it's still backwards, compatible with USB 2.0 for all the same stuff anyway. Inside this device is an absolutely ridiculous, spec list. This is the octa-core version here, so it has a 1.9 gigahertz quad-core processor and a one point three gigahertz quad-core processor, and it's got three gigabytes of RAM. So that would lead you to believe that the Galaxy Note 3 is a monster performer and it is it handles just about any application. I throw at it both regular and every day and even heavy testing with just ease. It'S graphic performance was smooth and gaming, responsive to my finger and stylus input. They were both fantastic and scrolling around larger web pages and heavy applications was smooth on most devices. You may have heard that Samsung has been known to sort of ramp up the CPU cores when it detects that you're running a benchmark application, so I am done with showing benchmarks on samsung devices, but you can trust me. Not only is this device fast, but it shows off how fast it is now. I have hopes that this kind of speed will stay with this device for a much longer period of time, because this guy is running Android 4.3. The first version of Android to support trim, which is probably the most underrated feature in this newest version of jellybean, but the bottom line here is that the phone flies through everything you'd expect it to and all the same stuff that the Galaxy Note 2 and galaxy S4 fly through also, but the Galaxy Note 3 has some tricks up its sleeve and it packs some new unique features that make this more than just a spec bump, upgrade from the note 2, and no I'm not talking about an extra color option or anything like That this is part of the note line, so a big deal with this device. Is this stylus? The note 3 stylus is redesigned from the one in the note to so it's a little more square. It fits in the phone upside down or right side up. It can also now click the capacitive menu and back keys on either side of the home button, and it comes with some new software features built into the phone to make it more useful but less obtrusive. So now, when you take the phone out, you take the stylus out of the phone. While the screen is on or off, you'll get a small circular window that pops up with the most commonly used touch with stylus features that you can hover over to read and then single tap on for easy access. I'M not a huge stylus user myself, but when I do use the stylus, when I actually take it out the phone, I usually know exactly what I want to do with it. So the pop-up window actually made it really quick and easy to get the stuff done. That I wanted to get done now, there's another feature in the Galaxy Note 3, that Samsung insists on including in every new Galaxy device and that's s voice, and it's of course present here on the Galaxy Note 3: it's still not that great! It'S still not even close to Siri or Google now, but they've added another feature for the Galaxy Note 3, where you can interact with it. While the display is still off sort of like the way you can on the Moto X with the Moto X, you would say: ok, Google now because it uses Google now. But since this uses s voice, it responds to high Galaxy weather uh-huh anytime, all right there. There we go so now: it's got the weather, it doesn't speak anything back to you, but it does give you a couple of limited options for information or if you want to text or call someone it'll do that. But you know it's not even close to Google. Now now, despite everything else, that was awesome about this phone on the inside, it is still a Samsung device, which means it's still running TouchWiz on top of Android. If you guys know me well, you already know I prefer stock Android over any sort of skin version of Android like this, but touch weighs still has its faults. It still has occasional jank. It still has the occasional hiccup and weird stutter that it really shouldn't have on a device with awesome. Specs like this, but I don't want to make it sound like Samsung. Skin is all garbage because it's not there are some features that I actually really like in it. I, like the Flipboard power to my magazine, app that can pop up from the bottom of the screen and aggregates all your social news kind of like blinkfeed on the HTC One I like having the quick toggles above the notification bar and the immediately available brightness toggle. That'S something I've gotten used to having. I also like the multi window feature and how much better it's getting with every update. I mean at this point. You can have two apps running in the background and one overtop of all of them. I mean you can multitask in your multitasking wall, multitasking, okay, it's it's pretty awesome. I mean it's just obvious that Samsung through every single possible feature they could into this device just like they did with the galaxy s4 everything, but the kitchen sink in hopes that something will get you to like it enough to buy it a familiar strategy, but using The Galaxy Note 3: there are two major things that I notice are the biggest improvements over the note 2. One is the display it's a 5.7 inch 1080p display, so that gives a super sharp pixel intensity of 386 pixels per inch and it's an AMOLED display and it's not a pentile matrix and it gets super bright and has great viewing angles. It'S super sensitive and it gets almost edge-to-edge on the display, so it's not quite edge to edge, but it's easily one of the best screens on any mobile phone right alongside the LG g2 and the HTC One top of the class and it's easily the note 3's Best physical asset, the other, is the camera. The note 3 is outfitted with a new 13 megapixel camera and you'll probably recognize that from the galaxy s4. So you'd expect the pictures to look about the same way as the galaxy s4 pictures do, but they don't there's some very updated image. Processing going on with the galaxy note: 3, some very aggressive, sharpening some noise reduction and they almost make the shots. Look a little bit over sharpened and over processed, which is a look that some people like and it'll work with some shots. But it's not always my favorite I'll leave a gallery of the full-size test shots that I took in the link right below that like button. So if you want to check them out, basically the full-size tops will get you a better idea of how they look. I think the pictures of thing takes are in a league of their own. It'S super fun to shoot with, especially because the viewfinder is that whole 5.7 inch display and the performance in regular light is pretty stellar. Dynamic range is pretty good and sharpness. Like we say with that, 13 megapixel sensor is quite good, but you can check all that out. For yourself and in terms of video mode. The Snapdragon 800 version of the Galaxy Note 3 that'll be sold in the United States, will shoot 4k Ultra High Definition, video. So that is just insanely sharp you'll probably never be able to share with anyone who will be able to watch it in native 4k. But I mentioned earlier that I would have liked to have seen optical image stabilization in the note 3's camera to smooth out that 4k video, but that's about the only downside to the camera. So when you think about it, a lot of the note 3's best features. Besides, the stylus functionality come from the Galaxy s4, so it'll keep being this way. As long as the Galaxy S line is updated before the Galaxy Note line every year, so you'd want to make sure the notes. Advantages over the s4 are very clear and very strong right now. These advantages are the stylus that the s4 doesn't have the larger display and slightly more RAM and more power and the much larger battery, and I think that's the kicker right now. That'S my favorite advantage. The huge battery I mentioned earlier that the Galaxy Note 3 here packs a 3,200 milliamp hour battery and it kicks ass all day every day. The Galaxy Note 3 is a reliable, all-day driver. It got me somewhere in the ballpark of 5 hours of screen on time with very heavy use. This is the same sort of use that got me less than 4 hours with the galaxy s4, so this is pretty impressive stuff as defin truly an all-day phone. So I guess what I'm saying here is I like this phone, I like a lot of things about this phone one of the hardest things to do when picking a new device is changing a screen size by a drastic amount. But once you go big, you never really go back once you get used to have a phone with the display, like this you'll, never look at the smaller devices. The same way again, I can guarantee you that the note 3 is one of those phones that isn't revolutionary and it isn't obviously the best phone out there or anything like that. But it's pretty damn good in every single department that could possibly make a phone good. It'S not perfect, it has it's quartz, it's definitely not perfect. It has the weird plastic backing material. It still has its settings menu that is so messed up that Samsung decided to throw in a search box. I mean it's definitely not perfect, but you could almost not care when you hop into your favorite applications and see how much more space you have and how much more smoothly they run. The experience is what really matters, and this is an awesome experience device. In conclusion, the Galaxy Note 3 is one of my favorite phones of 2013 and it's gon na be really difficult to move from a smaller device like I was using before, like the Moto X to something like this, but again we've talked about this before I easily Get used to a device like this, I came from something the size of a Galaxy Note. 2. So this isn't really all that big feeling in my hands and a lot of people who have been using a big device like this will say the same thing. It looks really big at first, but once you get used to using it, it feels like a totally normal sized phone. That being said, that's about it for this review of the galaxy note. 3.

WBeFfWUdseI,LG G2 Review!,8:11,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kip EHD here and it's been a long time coming waiting for the next Nexus. Why am I even talking about that? Well, this is the LG g2 aka the almost Nexus. Let me explain: let's go back a second to the Nexus. 4, when I first saw it, I said my review that this is the perfect combination between the previous Nexus, the Galaxy Nexus and LG's current flagship at that time, which was the lg optimus G and that's naturally, what happens when Google picks LG for the hardware partner For the Nexus, LG adapts something that they're already making into something that works with what Google wants. So in terms of design, a lot of that nexuses points came from the current LG flagship. At that time, the Optimus G now flash forward to 2013, where the next Nexus is right around the corner. The hardware partner for Nexus is still LG, and this is LG's current flagship, the LG g2. So you can think of this as the sort of almost Nexus. A peek into what we'll probably see running stock Android 4.4 KitKat in a couple of weeks on a Google event stage, and you can also see in this device what LG thinks it takes to take down the Galaxy s4 as the most popular Android phone right now And as it turns out, a lot of that involves copying what Samsung did with the Galaxy s4. First of all, though, there's no way around it, this phone is an absolute beast on paper. A lot of people don't realize it, but this phone flat-out wins the spec war right now, if that's, what you're into is a mighty Snapdragon 800 chip inside a 2 gigabytes of RAM 3000 milliamp hour battery in the United States, a 5.2 inch 1080p edge-to-edge display and A 13 megapixel optically stabilized camera, in other words, it's a beast. I know we say specs, don't matter that much, but it's kind of hard to deny that a device with these types of internals is going to perform well, but we'll get to that in a second. What'S really unique, though, about this LG g2 is the actual design of the device and the button layout. You may have noticed that there are no buttons on the top or on the right hand, side or on the left-hand side or on the bottom of the device. All of the buttons on the lg g2 are on the back, so it's interesting choice. It really keeps the phone feeling sleek and clean, and after a few quick days of actually using it, this I got used to it pretty quickly, which may seem weird. But what's nice is when you're holding the phone your hands tend to fall nicely in line with those buttons on the back, even if you don't have massive hands like me, I know I have big hands, but I've. Let other people try it, and the first reaction is usually well. At least my fingers are right. Where I hold it, they land right on the buttons everything else about. The design, though, is still similar to the Galaxy s4 that it's aiming at. They have a similar footprint similar shape, similar curvature and even very similar materials, though the g2 adds this metal band all the way around all the edges of the phone in an effort to feel, I guess a bit more premium, and both devices also have a removable Back coated with that super glossy plastic that I'm personally not really a fan of, we can always add a case or a decal to the back, like I did with my s4 later, but the g2 manages to have a slightly larger 5.2 inch HD IPS display with It'S much thinner, bezels and on-screen buttons instead of Samsung's physical ones, and this display by itself is excellent for a smartphone, brilliant brightness. So it's viewable just about anywhere plus a super high pixel density, very good color reproduction for an IPS display and good scratch resistant glass on top of everything, literally like a boss. Anyway, there are some other minor things about this hardware, like the downward facing speaker, which is pretty good and kind of loud, but also kinda, tinny and fires audio sideways when the device is in landscape mode and there's also, this hilariously long TV antenna on the Korean Version to get better reception for the preinstalled TV watching apps or you can use it to freak people out in the street. If you want to convince people, you have an insanely, weird, looking phone from the 80s or something, but let's get back to those buttons for a sec. When the display is off, you can actually hold down those back buttons. You can use the volume up button to quickly open LG's Notes, app or the volume down button as a shortcut to open the camera, which is a nice touch and speaking of the camera. It'S a strong point on this device, which gives me a glimmer of hope for a great camera on the next Nexus. The camera on the lg g2 here is fantastic, like it takes great pictures and video, and it's thanks to that sensor. The glass and the optical image stabilization, so the software thanks to LG's skin, is a little bit ugly and I'm not a fan of the viewfinder at all. But you can see exactly what they tried to do here. It'S almost as if they said to their software engineers, hey you see that Samsung Galaxy s4 camera feature. Your job is to build that into our camera boom. It'S in, they have dual shot. They have the photosphere mode. Everything is here: it's like Samsung added everything, but the kitchen sink at the end of the day. The photos it takes are really quite good. They'Re top-notch I'd say: the camera here is top three Android smartphone cameras I've ever used, although that may of course change very soon. But yeah I've been impressed with the photos it takes in any kind of light indoors or outdoors and it opens the camera and takes all these photos very quickly. Thanks to that software shortcut and the well immense power of the Snapdragon 800. So that's what matters to a lot of people and it's going to get these shots really quickly and taken in great quality. So the long story short here is that, from my experience, this is a potentially incredible device ruined by awful LG software, but yet gives me hope for the future at the same time, because if the next Nexus physically looks anything like this, I'm going to be a Very happy person, but all the biggest downsides for this device come from that LG skin on the top of Android. It'S Android 4.2, with this incredibly large LG UI. On top of it that I happen to think, looks quite ugly, inconsistent even a little bit tacky or Goudy. I mean there's unnecessary animations all over the place, distracting delays in the amount of time it takes for things to happen or to do things, changes just for the sake of changes and overall, just a ton of things that need to be cleaned up and that's just A simple way of putting it, I mean the first time I pull down the notification draw. I think my jaw was on the floor at how bad it looked really. I think they can do a lot better in this department, but what's crazy is the biggest Pro? Is the Snapdragon 800 doesn't even break a sweat? This phone is consistently fast and it seems like the skin, doesn't weigh it down at all. Maybe the skin isn't really all that heavy after all, or maybe the Snapdragon 800 is just that much of a beast, but it lasted all day with this crazy power thanks to the 3000 milliamp hour battery. So, even if you are lost in the software and it takes you forever to do what you want to do because of all the animations or changes, you can still rest assured that it'll keep doing exactly what it's doing all day at lightning speed. Thanks to that chip, that's for sure this phone is a Reimer, but if i was to consider using the g2 full-time, I would really wish it was a lot lighter a lot cleaner and I mean ultimately a lot closer to stock Android like a Nexus. So, at the end of the day, the lg g2 really is quite an interesting device. Obviously the biggest difference between it and just about any other device out. There is the buttons on the back and when people first see this for the first time, you're going to think it's insane, why would anyone have buttons on the back of their phone that just doesn't make sense on day 1 and day 2 of owning the phone? You might still think that, but on day 3 4 """
fsOxwsFF50c,Sony RX100 M2 Review!,7:25,"Hey what is up guys, I'm KB HD here - and this is the best pocket camera ever made thanks for watching now, but this is a bit of a secret weapon because, first of all I use this a lot. But then I never really talk to you guys about it, so I realized I figured. I should probably tell you guys a lot more about this particular device right here. I'Ve used footage from it in a couple of mkbhd videos. I take like all of my Instagram photos on it. Now I bring it anywhere, I go when I have an open pocket, so this is the Sony. Rx100 Mark. 2. Now I know a lot of you guys immediately go to the description and check out the price and when you guys see the price of this you're, probably going to first say no. No. I really don't want that, but I urge you to watch this video first and then tell me what you think. The rx100 mark 2 is basically a refined masterpiece. At this point, it ticks all the boxes and it makes some improvements over the original already legendary rx100 mark 1. Everything that can be good about a pocket. Camera is good about this cameras, so there are already about a million reviews of the original rx100 out there. On the internet, but here's the gist of what you need to know that makes this camera so good. First of all, first and foremost, is the 20 megapixel giant one inch sensor they put in this thing that is bigger and more sensitive than any other camera. That fits in your pocket buy a lot with this bigger sensor. You get better low-light performance, a shallower depth of field and basically, overall, better image. Quality. Second, is the super fast carl zeiss lens, that's f, 1.8 at its widest focal length. It'S so that's pretty darn fast, it's 3.6 times optical zoom, and it also has optical image stabilization that works really well, there's also a pop-up flash that can be articulated and used to bounce light off the ceiling instead of blinding your subject every time. It also has a 3-inch super-bright, articulating, live view, LCD, that's viewable indoors and outdoors and can help you get your shots at pretty much any angle. Thanks to that new articulating hinge, it has just about every software feature and mode. You could possibly think of anywhere from full manual control over everything and raw or JPEG photos to the full, auto and all the creative modes, and even in HDR it has Wi-Fi NFC a hot shoe. It has a smooth turning ring around the lens that can be programmed to change, focus or aperture or really anything you want. It takes two chargeable batteries that last a long time and SD cards up to 128 gigabytes right now, and the build quality all around the outside is all metal. So this thing is built like a tank and it can be tossed into bags and traveled with all the time. The controls are well built too they're, well organized and easy to learn and they're, pretty clicky and responsive when in use, and on top of all of that, the images and video that come out of this camera are stunning. They are really good. So, even if you think this camera is the ugliest thing in the world, you can't deny the crystal-clear image. Quality colors are very accurate, photos are tack, sharp dynamic range is impressive, and basically, what I'm trying to say here is this blows. Every other pocket camera out of the water in this department autofocus, while you're taking photos, is super fast, very snappy, sharp and accurate, and it also has continuous autofocus during video recording at 1080p, which is also constantly very fast and accurate. Now I don't know about you, but with a lineup like this there's hardly any reason to consider any other pocket camera over this one at this price point. So if you guys remember, I did videos from CES and January in the beginning of this year, where I did some coverage of an Nvidia event: huawei device, sony device and at the end I did a huge 9 minute wrap-up of all of the highlights of CES. Yet 99 % of that footage from those videos came from this, you can actually cut between DSLR footage and rx100 footage in a single YouTube. Video and most people for the most part will not be able to tell the difference, especially because, like we said, the awesome optics, the great image quality and the shallow depth of field banks with the fast lens and the big sensor. It gives it that sort of DSLR like filmic, look when you're taking videos with it, and on top of all of that, this is what it's like to hold a DSLR while taking video. While this is what it's like to hold a pocket camera while taking video freehand, this camera could also be considered, may be the perfect vlogging camera, because a lot of the vlogging cameras you already see on YouTube are compact and have to take great quality video on A tiny package - this is exactly that this is probably even more compact on a lot of the other YouTube cameras out there, and it takes much better video quality at arm's length. Now I don't happen to do this style, video all that often, but if you do like I did at CES, then you'll find that delivers well pretty much awesome quality and it's much much easier to do this kind of style with this than with a DSLR. So what are the main differences between the mark 2 and the mark 1? You may ask well the mark 2 here, has Wi-Fi NFC a hot shoe on the top and an articulating LCD screen on the back. If you can live without these four features, then might I suggest, saving a little bit of money and getting be still godlike rx100 mark 1 and saving yourself quite a bit of money, but I actually really love having the mark 2 for that Wi-Fi plus NFC capability, Which makes it brilliant for smart phone control so overall the rx100 and rx100 mark 2 clearly an incredible camera, just a really really great buy for anyone, and I would argue that this could be the full time only camera for a lot of youtubers out there. Now I see a lot of youtubers go out and buy a DSLRs which is sort of a larger, more unwieldy body. For that cinematic, look, the shallow depth of field and the quality that you get, but then they never take advantage of the interchangeable lenses that you're supposed to use with a DSLR they'll use the same lens all the time, and I would argue that this is a Better buy because this gets you the same quality, the same image style and it's smaller, it's cheaper and it's just significantly easier to shoot with. Like I said you can get that optical image. Stabilization is built in so you don't have to worry about getting a lens with that. You can use it with one hand and check your phone at the same time you can vlog with it is so much more versatile than a DSLR and it fits in your pocket and you can take the quality anywhere. It'S a great camera. So now you can check the price. I know you probably have it in a new tab anyway, but honestly, if I was still giving ratings like numerical values for devices like this, it would probably be one of those rare 10 out of 10. That just doesn't have any real flaws to hold the back. It'S arguably the perfect camera, but either way. Thank you for watching this video and a lot more mkbhd. Videos are to come because these are like the two most exciting months of tech september/october. So I'm really excited thumbs up for that. Most importantly, let me know if you guys want to see more like device like smaller device reviews like this. I haven't reviewed this camera, the one I'm shooting this on right now. I have my Amazon gear list in the description of every video and a lot of the stuff on that list. I have not reviewed yet, so let me know if there are things on that list that you want to see me make a video about like I said thanks for watching, and I will talk to you guys in the next video """
Fi1JUykQBKw,Nokia Lumia 1020 Review!,10:36,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm Kay PhD here - and this is the latest highest end Windows Phone device from Nokia, mostly because the camera? That'S a lot of the reason why anyone is even talking about this phone or considering it at all. But there's a lot more to a phone than just the camera, but we're going to take a look at everything about this latest device. This is the full review of the Nokia Lumia 1020. Now we all know the Nokia Lumia series is a family of Windows Phone devices and that seems to be their defining feature. This is the highest end, one of the bunch and, to be honest, it's pretty similar to the rest of the Nokia Windows phones. At first glance, it has that big body, it's pretty thick bright, colors, rounded corners, but a squared off top and bottom, and it's got that button layout at the bottom that all the rest of the Windows Phone devices also have. But it's pretty amazingly well built actually with no seams on the back or any of the sides. It'S basically a single block, slab design with a display on the front, and everything is milled from that single block, so the buttons the volume rocker, the milled speakers on the bottom. Everything is part of that single block design. It'S also a very big phone, like bigger than the Moto X, in every way, bigger and wider than the Galaxy s4 thicker than a galaxy s4 heavier than the galaxy s4. But of course, we already expected that out of a Nokia Windows Phone but holding in the hand, it actually feels pretty great, it has a well balanced heft to it, and its mass has 158 grams. So you really feel like you're holding a solid device in your hand when you're using it, which is nice and, of course, you're about to notice when you're using it that when you turn it around to the back, that is where you'll find the massive hump or The imaging hardware resides so that's your 41 megapixel PureView sensor, the Carl Zeiss glass and the xenon flash, and the focus is his light, all top-notch optics, but we'll get to that in just a second. The main disruptor here is that the camera hump is so big that it affects the rest of using the phone. Sometimes I wasn't quite sure where to put my fingers on the back of the phone while using it and, more importantly, it never sits flat on any table. So, if you're someone who likes to text while their phone is lying on a desk or something you can count out that sort of activity on this Lumia inside it's also very similar to other Nokia Windows phones, it's rocking a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4 chip. A two-year bytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of internal storage and a 2,000 milliamp hour, but we all know that windows phones, don't really need insane specs to handle everything they do really well and from my everyday usage, I've found this to be true with this phone Too, this one performs really well for a heavy user. Like me, it handles everyday tasks, really smoothly opens and closes apps quickly, scrolling as nice, as ever of course, on Windows, Phone and multitasking is a breeze thanks to those two gigs of RAM. Now one thing I noticed about web browsing in Internet Explorer here was that it's definitely smooth, but at the expense of a lot of checkerboarding and blank spaces when zooming in and out or scrolling quickly kind of reminds me of the older phones. That did that, like the LG Voyager, where once you zoom in on text, you have to wait for it to re-render. Anyway, you can pull off some gaming on this phone too. Now. Obviously, this is Windows Phone. So there aren't exactly a ton of games to choose from, but with the few games I was able to try it work smoothly and quickly without a hitch, and I got great frame rates of course, and that's the way it should be right. So so far, so good next onto the display so see there aren't that many high end resolution Windows Phone 8 devices, and this one is no exception. Really it's a 4.5 inch 1280 by 768 display a lot of people are thinking, wait a second Wow a device. That'S bigger and thicker and wider than the Galaxy s4 has a smaller display than the Moto X yeah. When you take a closer look at it, you'll realize just how much bezel we're working with here on this device and then there's a resolution which gives it a pixel density of 334 pixels per inch, which is not bad. But now there is something else worth noting about the windows phone UI, specifically some apps like, for example, the calendar, have one pixel wide elements of it, which allows you to literally see the entire width of the pixel and when you start to look at it closely, You'Ll immediately start seeing individual pixels and that's something I just couldn't wrap my head around the fact that the highest end Windows Phone device - you can buy right now. You can see pixels on the display. It'S disappointing considering I've seen much much better displays in much less expensive devices. Everything else about the display, though, is really not that bad. It has great color reproduction, first of all, good viewing angles too, and since it's an AMOLED display, the contrast ratio is great and whenever you have a black background or the black elements of the display, those pixels are not being lit at all, which makes them look Pure black and also makes for great battery life, they don't have to light those pixels and this phone lasted a full day which is great on battery, but enough about the rest of the phone. I know what you're here for that camera. This has a 41 megapixel camera on the back. So is any good well, the short answer is yes, it's the best camera on any smartphone right now, like any phone period. So there's that, but it's also one of those cameras that just really makes you want to get out and take pictures of everything, because you know the pictures just going to turn out well every single time now there are a number of things to address about the Picture-Taking experience before the image quality because everyone seems to want to focus on the image quality. First of all, this is a pretty wide angle lens on the back on purpose. Second, this is a real xenon flash, so it uses a focus, assist light and then actually fires a flash like a real digital camera instead of the typical smartphone LED light. Third, this phone comes with a specialized Nokia pro cam app. So, yes, you could use the stock Windows Phone camera app, but that doesn't make much sense. It doesn't take advantage of it. So the pro cam app is included here to take advantage of all those pixels. Next, the camera UI here is a really smart one. You can leave it in full, auto if you want and it pretty much always takes great pictures in full, auto or you can use the controls to change up the settings one by one. So you can manually adjust exposure compensation, the shutter speed, the ISO, the focus or the white balance and, of course you can turn flash on and off. So basically, all these controls are up at the touch of a finger up at the top they're. Very out of the way, so you can still see your image, so let's say you're outdoors and you want to have a really fast shutter speed to freeze action. You can basically take the shutter speed off auto and pick the shutter speed that you want, make it nice and fast, and it basically goes into shutter priority mode. Everything else stays automatic and you can see the ISO automatically adjusting as you move around it'll turn red to let you know when you've gotten a bit too high, but basically you want to avoid that and again, like I said this, do you find or is super Smart it'll automatically adjust all the other things about the image to make it work with that shutter speed and you can snap your picture and freeze the image and one more thing. This lens has real optical image stabilization, so you can get a sharper image during longer. Shutter times or one video recording, all that is stabilized last thing you need to know is that in the time between shots, there's a really big delay here and, unfortunately, there's also no burst mode, and there is no built-in HDR processing. So it may feel a little bit slow, but without any further ado I took a ton of pictures while using the Lumia as my daily driver. So here are some of the most impressive pictures I took with it over the past two weeks check these out all right. So the main takeaway here from the images that I took was that the biggest strength here was the sharpness thanks to all those pixels and the optical image stabilization and the biggest weakness I think, was color. I took a lot of these pictures in full, auto with autotune the color accuracy was really hit or miss, and sometimes it was way wrong, not even even close, and it was even more apparent in the video I took. So you can see this video right here from the Train, where the colors are basically shifted and not at all very lifelike. Now this Nokia pro cam app, also has a few more tricks up its sleeve. First of all, for the photos it takes a 38 megapixel full resolution shot and also, at the same time, saves a 5 megapixel over sampled image, which was much smaller and file size and that's what you can use to share to Twitter, Instagram, etc. Wherever windows fun will let you share, and it actually felt like a lot of these five megapixel oversampled shots were a bit sharper than the full res ones. Another trick it has up its sleeve is to crop and reframe your shots after the fact - and this is what Nokia is advertising everywhere. So sense is a 38 megapixel shot and a wide-angle lens. You can basically crop and reframe the shot exactly the way you want. It and resave it and keep tons of detail. This gives you a lot more flexibility when taking pictures of landmarks and landscapes, groups of people, animals, moving objects, etc. It'S really great very useful, so it is indeed a great camera experience. Of course again, it is almost always going to take amazing pictures on the first try and full auto mode. My big problem. What I would say is that it's a 41 megapixel sensor with a 720p viewfinder, so there's tons of line, skipping and Moray stuff and sometimes pictures really don't look that great when you're taking it on the phone but then go and check it on the computer and It looks amazing, so, at the end of the day, you have to be the one to decide if you want the best camera and a phone so badly, that you're willing to switch to Windows, Phone and all of its quirks, which there are a lot of and As a person who uses a lot of Google services, this is a tough sell because of course, Microsoft and Google are not exactly friends at this point and there's plenty missing from Windows Phone that I would love to have and you got to decide if you're willing To switch to Windows Phone and go all-out just to get this incredible camera or, if you're just going to wait and stick to the already really great cameras and a lot of the other phones with different operating systems. If I was already a Windows Phone person, I would be all over this phone. This is the phone to get. If you want Windows Phone there's, pretty much. No other choice right now, they're all already pretty big phones, so you might as well just go with the slightly larger one and get a 41 megapixel sensor that delivers incredible optical image quality either way. There is pretty much nothing else to say this is a great device if you guys are liking, especially the color choices, there's a gray, a white, a black and a yellow, and I of course went with yellow because that seems pretty sweet, but otherwise that's been it. Thank you for watching. If you enjoyed this video feel free to give a thumbs up below and there's also a subscribe button below. If you want to get more of the videos, I upload like this.

CJTlB_S7ct0,Motorola Moto X Review!,13:31,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm Kip EHD here, and this is the phone that a lot of people have been talking about recently. This is the Moto X. It'S the first phone at the collaboration directly between Google and Motorola. Since Google bought Motorola Mobility more than a year ago, so we expected big things out of this phone and now it's time to give it the full review treatment so how'd any further ado. Let'S take a closer look at the Moto X, so yeah. This device is different. It'S really different in a lot of ways from the competitors and a lot of these differences come from Motorola, taking bets on what the average consumer wants on a phone, not a geek. I'M hate a video explaining this not too long ago. It'Ll, be the first link right below that like button on this video, but, from my perspective, a geeks perspective, actually giving the phone a chance. This phone really impressed me in a lot of ways. First of all, the design, this phone is a really subtle compact, handsome design for a phone motorola basically decided that a phone with a rounded back is easier to hold, so they built it around that and they built. What i think is one of the nicest curves in any phone out there much better to hold than what we saw attempted in the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. So the Moto X has a curved back and it fits well in the hand, and it's actually has a stacked battery inside - to take up all that space we'll get to the battery in a second. But basically, this bone is packed to the gills with the internals. The storage is not expandable, it uses a nano SIM instead of a regular Micro SIM, it's crazy, but the phone feels super solid, oh, and it also helps that this phone has a rubberized back. So it's not velocity plastic like the galaxy s4, but it's also not solid metal like the HTC One. So it's a nice sweet spot right in between and I like it. It also has a dimple right in the middle of the back, and I just really like it for some reason: I'm not sure why, but I'm glad is there and again that soft touch back is just a great feel for anything handheld. The one thing I don't like about the outside is the headphone jack being up on the top, but that's really a minor complaint, just a preference. But alongside that headphone jack, you will find a microphone and you'll find another microphone in the chin of the phone. And yet another one on the back, so this phone has three microphones essentially for noise cancellation to be able to isolate voices which it'll need now inside the Moto X is the reason why a lot of spec heads have a hard time wrapping their head around this Phone so check this out. It'S essentially rocking multiple CPUs, some of which are dedicated to certain tasks all in order to optimize battery life. They call it the x8 system and they're made up of the dual core main processor, a version of the 1.7 gigahertz Snapdragon s4. Pro then, it has the quad core, Adreno 320 GPU for graphics and a dedicated core for contextual computing and gesture recognition and another dedicated core for natural language processing and voice recognition. That makes 8 cores in this phone all handling their own power states to optimize different things. So how does the performance end up pretty damn? Well, actually, it's scary good. It might not benchmark like a boss, but I can guarantee you. It feels and performs like one. Every day of the week it handles multitasking well handles scrolling. Well, it happens, opening and closing apps well, very quick. It actually handles web browsing exceptionally well. In fact, this and the new Nexus 7 were the only devices that really glide through Google Chrome on any site. I throw at it. Google Chrome has been notoriously a power sucker and can lag on a lot of these high-end devices, but it's crazy when you think about it. This device is one of the smoothest of them all, there's, never any stuttering or lag in the UI. Like you might see in TouchWiz or HTC Sense, and overall, this phone has been buttery smooth every second, since I first got it, which is really impressive. I can't say the same about stuff like the Samsung Galaxy s4, and a lot of this has to do with the fact that number one this is very close to vanilla, Android and number two. This is a 720p display, so this moto X is rocking a 1280 by 720 Super AMOLED display, which means it has way less pixels to push around than a 1080p display, and the GPU doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But is this bad for the viewing experience short answer? Nope in fact take it from me, someone who absolutely loves resolution and high pixel density. The only time I can see a difference between this and a 1080p display of the same size like the HTC One is, when you put them side-by-side right next to each other, and the average person is never going to do that. The average person is never going to spot a pixel on this display. It comes in at 316, pixels per inch right in line with the iPhone 5 and has a very bright saturated colors. Thanks to that AMOLED display nice contrast, nice viewing angles and everything. It was a little bit warm in color temperature and I would have liked it to be a little bit more act. But then again that's what you expect from an AMOLED display and you can really only tell the difference when you're holding it next to an IPS display. So yeah, I would say the trade-off Motorola made here was a good move, as the display still looks. Tax sharp to my eyes and the frame rates are through the roof when compared to other 1080p phones. Also, the Moto X takes advantage of that AMOLED display with its unique Notification peak system. So when your phone is not in use and it's facing up like on your lap or on a table, it sort of breathes the Notification peak in and out and when you want to check it, you just tap and hold, and you can read your latest notification Up top all of the rest of your notifications will be shown down below and you can swipe down to unlock and get to those anytime. You get a new notification it'll take over the top window, so you can peek that I kind of wish I was able to peek at more than one notification at once, but for now it's just the newest one one at a time now, if any other smartphone Without an AMOLED display, I attempted to do this kind of thing. It would burn through the battery life super fast, since that is an AMOLED display. These thin white characters, you see, are the only pixels being lit, so the rest of the display is still off, so it really doesn't take much power at all. Now I mentioned earlier that there is a dedicated cord just for natural language processing on the Moto X, and that actually brings us to one of my favorite features on the Moto X. And even if it's not a feature that people are going to use all the time, I think it's going to impress a lot of people and when a lot of people start to get to use this they're not going to want to go to another phone. That doesn't have this, and that is the ability to speak to your phone and have it give you answers and perform actions without you even touching it or waking it. So the Moto X can be completely asleep and I can go you want to say. I want to ask for the weather - and I just want to know what the weather is outside. I can just say: okay, Google, now what's the weather outside now, there's a little bit of a delay before it gives me the weather? That'S because it actually needs to finish listening and then wake up. The Google now service and then punch in all the information and then search it and then deliver the answer. So there's a little bit of a process, so it may not seem as natural and quick to just ask the phone a question. Have it immediately deliver answer as if it was already awake, but it is a cool feature and I think a lot of people are gon na like it? Ok, Google! Now, how tall is the Empire State Building our State Building is 1,000, so there's another one of those things that most phones would chomp through battery if they tried since they'd, be activating all of their cores to pull it off. The Moto X, like we said, has a dedicated, low-power chip just for this kind of stuff. It also recognizes your voice from when you first set it up, and it actually does a really great job, thanks to all those microphones of rejecting other noise and isolating your voice and not responding to other people who don't sound like you. But anyway, speaking of battery life, since clearly Motorola made in a lot of decisions just for the battery life, the x8 chip, the 720p display, turns out the battery life is really good. Now motorola claims 24 hours of battery life. Maybe a lighter user could get that out of it, but I didn't, but I still got an absurd number closer to 14 to 16 hours of battery life out of this phone. You really have to be using it all day to kill it and it is most certainly a longer-lasting phone than the galaxy s4 or the HTC One, and the remarkable thing is this: isn't even a huge battery physically, it's actually smaller than those other phones. It'S a 2200 milliamp hour battery, but you know motorola knows battery and that's the thing they've had a lot of experience with it. They made the Droid RAZR MAXX. I am very very pleased with the battery life in the Moto X, especially considering its size and, of course, on the back of the Moto X. You also have your camera and on the back, what we're looking at here is a 10 megapixel sensor and a single LED flash, but more about the sensor. It'S what they call a clear, pixel sensor and Motorola has never been really good with cameras. Shall we say I mean they don't exactly have the highest end: camera phones on the market. I was expecting this to be a little bit different, but I'll just go ahead and tell you now it is not a good camera. It is the biggest disappointment of the entire phone I'll go ahead and say right now. The biggest was disappointing problem on the Moto X is the camera. The RGB clear pattern layout is supposed to be better for taking in low-light shots and getting in more light for faster shutter speeds, and it does do that and that actually does work for getting more light. But overall, the pictures that it takes were extremely extremely disappointing. You can activate the camera UI pretty quickly with a quick double rotation about its axis, so that's a nice shortcut and to get into the camera UI, which is pretty simple again targeting iPhone users and the average people with this one, but it's at least decent. Looking. It'S also really simple. I think my problem with the UI was that it was a little bit too simple, like there's no way to select metering, so you just kind of have to trust that the phone gets the brightness right, but it's not always trustworthy. If you have a very dark and a very light subject in the same frame, but otherwise all the other controls are pretty easy to get to with a couple of swipe gestures, but the picture quality itself and not good. I would out characterize these shots. I took with it as muted and soft muted, with the colors and soft in the sharpness department, just very, very consistently soft. Every time trust me, I check to see if there was still the plastic over the lens so many times it's not the pictures. I they really are consistently this soft when compared to other smartphones, and it's even more noticeable when you compare it to something like the iPhone 5 or the galaxy s4. Now it's fortunate that at least this is camera firmware, so the camera firmware and the image processing are something that can be updated via and over-the-air update. So in theory, Motorola could fix this with a quick software upgrade anytime they want, but for now that is the biggest disappointment for me in the Moto X and then there are, you know little things like the software feeling slightly unfinished. Maybe a bit rushed. You know the 18 t model. I have has this weird random gap in the notification bar every time, I'm on Wi-Fi and when you turn the quick toggle sideways, they get a little weird and they don't take up all the space and even that translucent on screen navigation bar at the bottom. While I like that, it's really good, it's also pretty inconsistent and they're, sometimes they're clear, sometimes they're black again. If Motorola is listening, these things can be fixed with software updates, but right now they are the biggest complaints, also about the speaker on the back. It'S crisp and loud, but it's also quite small and can easily be muted, with a poorly misplaced finger check this out. You know what, beyond all its little minor shortcomings, I really love using the Moto X. It'S been one of my favorite phones to mess around with. In a long time - and it's about the experience - and it definitely delivers way beyond what a lot of us expected it to when we looked at the specs, you know thin bezels, lovely typing experience. Nice compact, design, sharp crisp, bright, colorful display a great performer. It'S just a lot of fun in a little box and it's probably perfect for someone coming from an iPhone or any first-time Android user, and on top of all of that, on top of everything we just talked about, this phone has a customizable look. This is a massive differentiator. That'S just like icing on the cake for this devices appeal. You can pick your back color, there's a ton of those. Your front can be black or white, and you can pick the trim color that goes around the camera ring and volume buttons, so you can, for the first time, really make this device your own and get it to your doorstep in the United States. In just four days, starting in September, so fingers crossed for international availability ASAP. We know it's coming, it's just a matter of when so. In the end, the Moto X is definitely a really nice phone, especially to use and to hold. It definitely feels really great in the hand, and for this reason this is going to be a phone that I recommend a lot of people who are using Android for the first time, switchers from the iPhone from windows phones from blackberries from other smaller phones, because this Is incredibly easy for them to get used to in terms of size and in terms of functionality, because this is stock pure Android and it will likely be getting Android 4.3 pretty soon. And even if it's not appealing to us, geeks us pixel junkies, who love the bigger display of the galaxy note 2 and the note three soon and all kinds of other incredibly high-end, specs and processing power, even if it's not appealing to all of us. I think this phone is going to sell better than a lot of other devices we've seen recently, and I think it's a pretty awesome first step in the collaboration between Google and Motorola so either way that's been the Moto X review. I hope you enjoyed it feel free to share this around with your friends. I spent a lot of time on this review video.

wEpMtf6nJco,Nexus 7 (2013) Review!,7:57,"Hey what's up guys mkbhd here and if you remember the first Nexus 7, that was one of the most popular Android tablets of all time, mostly thanks to that bang for the buck ratio is a lot of tablet for a very low price. So here comes the second generation, the 2013 Nexus 7 is brand new, and while there are a lot of minor improvements and a lot to the spec upgrades that you get with a new version of any device, there are three main reasons why this tablet can actually Be considered the best Android tablet that you can buy right now for any price. So if any further ado, let's go ahead and take a closer look. This is a full review of the 2013 Nexus 7. So the first of the three things that make this tablet so great is the form factor. This is, of course, a tablet with a 7-inch display and it's sort of a mid-sized device that puts it right between one-handed and two-handed use. If you want to type out a long email or something you can use two hands on that keyboard or if you just want to scroll on a magazine or use it casually, it's easily a one-handed device as well. A lot of this is because the Nexus 7 is so light coming down to just 290 grams, which is now slightly lighter than the iPad Mini and about the same thinness as the iPad Mini as well, which is impressive and overall, is very comfortable to hold. It. Has that soft touch back with gentle curves in your hand - and this also happens to be a very well balanced tablet, which is harder to do than you might think? It'S not top heavy or bottom heavy. The battery is just about where you'd want it to be, and we'll talk about that a little later, but it's in just the right spot, where no matter how I'm holding it's a pleasure to use now there are some notable changes to the outside when compared to The old Nexus 7, those are the bezels, the speaker and the camera on the back. The bezels are indeed thinner on the sides but bigger on the top and the bottom, which actually makes it a bit narrower and taller and at first glance you might think all those unsightly bezels. Why do they do that? It looks so ugly. But when you start using the tablet, you soon realize that these bezels are really the only place to put your fingers when holding it in landscape mode, watching videos, gaming etc. So it's actually a good thing that they put these there for easier use. The speaker's are new and they're pretty good. There are stereo speakers and they're located on the opposite sides of the back of the device. Now, yes, they're still back facing speakers and as someone spoiled by the Nexus tense, front-facing speakers, it's kind of hard to go back to these rear-facing tablet speakers, but on the whole, these are quite nice at normal volumes and they distort a little bit at high volumes. But I think this is one of the parts of the tablet where they skimped a little bit to save money and try to enhance it. After the fact, using some virtual surround sound software, it didn't really work. These are just you know, normal sounding stereo speakers and then we're at that five megapixel rear facing camera. I just want to say it's a camera on a tablet. I wouldn't expect it to be good in any way, and at this point it kind of confuses me. Why they chose to include it anyway? The images and video it takes are pretty muted in color, not very sharp, and this Nexus 7 is thirty bucks more expensive than the first generation. Couldn'T they have hit that magical $ 1.99 price point again if they didn't include this cheap, crappy, camera sensor and glass on the back? I don't know who knows, but you know you still look at it and feel a little bit awkward taking pictures on your tablet. Anyway, so I would just ignore the fact that there's a camera on this one now the second thing, the second thing that makes this tablet so magnificent and it's easily. My favorite feature is the new display. It'S not just a great display for a tablet. That'S only 230 bucks, it's a great display for a tablet period. I love the Nexus 7's new display and anyone who loves pixels with me will love it too. It'S in 1920 by 1200 panel, which gives it a pixel density of 323 pixels per inch. That'S the sharpest of any tablet on the market right now. It'S also the best viewing angles and colors of any tablet on the market right now, it's also an IPS display that gets brighter than any other tablet on the market right now, it's just phenomenal. It'S incredibly responsive every time. I turn it on. I smile a little bit because using a tablet with a display like this is such a pleasure. It makes you never want to put it down. So that leaves the third and final reason that this tablet has stolen. My heart, and that is the operating system. It'S a nexus now listen. I'Ve used a lot of Android tablets and phones out there, and there are a lot of great Android skins on phones that are actually catching up to the fluidity and experience from stock Android. Since 5:00, on HTC one is a good example: that's becoming a more even playing field, but there is nothing just nothing else that comes close to a nexus experience on tab. It'S right now. I have serious trouble recommending an Android tablet that isn't running stock Android or something close to it. The Nexus 7 is no exception. It performs beautifully well inside of it is a 1.5 gigahertz sort of beefed up Snapdragon s4 pro, which is a great chip and 2 gigabytes of RAM, but by the way it performs and handles all of the simultaneous apps and multitasking general everyday use and responsiveness. I really don't care what's inside, because this thing kicks ass. Now I did a separate video all about the newest features of Android 4.3. So if you want to check that out, it'll be in the description right below that like button, but overall new customizations and trim support, especially are just a home run on this tablet, so much fun to use. In fact, I would think I think fun is a great word to describe this tablet. I found that if someone recommended an app or something for me to check out, I could just download it install it and start playing it in a matter of seconds without a hint of any sort of delay, which is great. I'Ve had a lot of fun using this tablet. It really nails the experience and the performance in the graphics, as you can see here, with all the reflections and live rendering and physics that's going on it's as high-end as it gets right now I mean if you want to play games. This tablet is so lightweight. It'S almost a no-brainer thanks to the form factor. Now. All of this awesome stuff comes with one major downside. Remember how I told you the Nexus 7 is the same thinness as the first gen iPad Mini yeah, it's thinner than last year's Nexus 7, which means it also has a smaller battery in physical size, we're looking at a 3950 million of our battery here. This all means it won't last, quite as long during regular constant use, you probably get about eight or nine hours out of it, but what's nice, is it burns almost no battery in standby mode? I had one night where I forgot to plug it in at 27 percent and I woke up the next morning and I was at 26, so it's also a really really power sipper when it's in standby and it's also compatible with the chief standard for wireless charging. So if you pick up a couple wireless chargers, you can have them in convenient locations, maybe an office or your home. So you never really have to worry about battery life, but you should know that this is indeed a smaller physical battery than the last Nexus 7. But dude this tablet is so much fun, you'd be hard-pressed to find something, that's genuinely bad to say about it. I'Ve enjoyed using this tablet so much during the time that I've had it. I honestly think you will too so at the end of the day. The Nexus 7 is another great tablet, and it's got a lot of reasons to upgrade to it over the old Nexus, 7 or any other Android tablet out there, just because the price is so good. The performance is so good and the display, especially, is so good. I could recommend a salad for just about anyone. I'M likely going to be switching to this, as my main tablet from the Nexus 10 that I was using earlier, just because it's a lot smaller and more portable, but it keeps that awesome display. I love the Nexus. 10 display, but now I also love the Nexus 7 display - and this is more portable, so I'll be able to put all my text books on here and not carry a ton of heavy things in my backpack all the time, either way, that's been it.

TK4u6wm-HIk,Google Chromecast Review!,7:35,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here - and you may have seen me - tease or hint a little bit on Twitter about the next two weeks or so of mkbhd videos, because they are going to be filled with a lot of awesome stuff. But this is the beginning of it. This is the full review of Google's chromecast one of Google's newest products that was announced alongside the new Nexus 7, which I also have coverage of coming up very soon. But this is the chromecast. So there's a lot of cool things about this product. It is a very simple product, but it does have a lot of implications about the future of what Google is gon na be focusing on. But basically chromecast is a dongle that you plug into your TV via HDMI, that turns it into a smart TV of sorts. Now, as a box actually says, it's the easiest way to watch online video on your TV - and I agree with that. But you can see here. The focus is on the video, but it does a bit more than just video as you'll see in a second. So when you get your chromecast, you of course get everything in this convenient little box here and when you open it up inside on the left, are all the instructions you need to set it up for the first time and you only have to set it up Once I got mine done and literally about two minutes flat, so it's pretty easy and aside from the chromecast, you get a USB cable for power, an HDMI extender. If your TV's HDMI port is a bit hard to reach and a power brick which you only have to use, if you can't get USB power from your TV, but most newer TVs have powered USB ports anyway. So this isn't going to be a thing that everyone needs to use. The chromecast itself is pretty small, it's just a dongle. Obviously the HDMI is on one side to plug it in and USB input for power and a small reset button on the other side. Also side note chromecast, and everything inside of it is mostly based on Android, not Chrome, which makes the logo and the name of the product in the Box a little bit misleading, but whatever that doesn't actually matter. So you plug your chromecast into the back of your regular TV, not a smart TV. It doesn't really matter. You hook it up to USB power, whether that's into the wall or into the USB port. On your TV follow the two minutes, setup guide and boom. You are ready to cast so my chromecast has a name. It'S called Marquez's, chromecast, very clever, and it's connected to my Wi-Fi network, which is called mkbhd so now every supported device, that's also on the mkbhd network, can see and cast to this chromecast enable TV. So right now supported devices include every Android device, every iPhone, every iPad and every computer running. Google Chrome, thanks to the chromecast Chrome extension, so I'll put the link right below that like button for that. If you want to try it out, first, with the portable devices, when you run your chromecast, is turned on, you'll actually see a chromecast button on the top of the YouTube app. The Google Play Movies app, the Google Play Music app and unfortunately, those Plus Netflix and Pandora are the only apps that natively support chromecast. But since the API is out - and now it's brand-new hopefully we'll see way, more apps like Hulu and Plex and Spotify, and even Dropbox and more showing up with this button, so press that button once and choose your chromecast TV and the media. You were playing on your mobile device, will now begin to buffer and start playing on your TV, so your device is now a remote control for the media. On your TV, you have all your playback controls. You can view the cue and add stuff to the cue you can go ahead and pause and play the media with the tap of a finger with a very, very tiny delay between the button press and the action. You can go ahead and adjust the volume. If you want, you can even totally exit the app and go do whatever else you want it to do on your device. While the media continues playing on your TV because you don't have to have the app open, but if I so go ahead and show you notification controls in the notification center, which is pretty sweet on Android, I've actually seen a lot of reviewers and people talking about The chromecast, using a bit of what I would say, bad phrasing or bad word choice. It makes it seem like you are beaming the content directly from the device to the TV. But that is not what is going on here. What'S happening is you're actually transferring the action from your device to your TV, so the chromecast has an internet connection of its own. So when you're playing YouTube video on your phone and tap the chromecast button, the chromecast then looks up the YouTube, video and start streaming. It on its own independent of what your phone is doing same deal with Google Play Music and when it starts streaming it's on its own independent of your phone. If you're listening to a song on your phone's own internet connection, you hit the chromecast button, then your phone tells the chromecast what song it was listening to essentially and your chromecast goes and looks up the song and pulls it down all by itself and start playing From there that's why locally stored media is so weird right now with the chromecast. It'S really not meant for that. Think of this as the Nexus Q reloaded, Google Play Movies works. The same way hit that cast button and you're suddenly streaming a movie directly from the cloud to your TV. The device is just an idle remote for you to do whatever it wants, use open, other applications, multitask whatever it's totally free and that's actually kind of a nice feature I found out the quality of the media was also pretty great. I have a 1080p TV here, so I know immediate it and for the first few seconds of playback of a video, sometimes the videos were a little bit soft. But after a few seconds of buffering, it's sharpened right up to full HD quality, which was nice now for the stuff. That'S not natively supported. Yet there is always Chrome's extension that allows for individual tabs streaming through chromecast, so you download the extension for Chrome pair it up with your TV and start casting and then you're actually sending content over your internet connect to your TV. So this one's a little more weird, if you have a solid connection, then the will it'll be pretty fast. They'Ll obviously be a slight delay when scrolling around a web page - and you know sometimes I couldn't see my mouse while on the TV while casting only on my laptop screen but then again. The quality here is pretty good. It starts off low quality when the casting is initiating, but after a few seconds it sharpens right up, and you can read whole articles of text watch full screen, videos and basically browse the web, like you would on your laptop. So if you want to show someone a neat website or an article or some video or something that's not in YouTube or Google Play, you can just go ahead and stream. Your tab cast your tab over to your TV and start showing people your internet. In that way, so that's pretty cool that you're not restricted to just supported apps again when that API rolls out it'll smoke being supported like everywhere, and you won't have to worry about streaming your tabs all the time. I also tried to stream my entire desktop and but that actually ended up crashing. I guess that's too many pixels for it to handle. So in the end, that's it! That'S the Google chromecast. My full review probably could have been 10 seconds of me. Just saying hey, it makes your TV smart and it's only 35 bucks buy it. You know it's pretty simple: no buy, probably an instant buy for a lot of people who have a TV, but don't have a smart TV, and this is everything the Nexus Q wanted to be, but never really got to be because the price was just totally wrong. So either way this is a US only product, it's really only available on the Play Store and from Amazon right now and it's kind of hard to get, which is why it'll be probably happy to know that I'll be giving away. One of these I have an extra Google chromecast I'll, be giving away, probably the same day that this video was uploaded so either today or tomorrow. Within 24 hours of this upload check out the Twitter link in the description for more details on how to get in on that giveaway it'll, be pretty simple and it'll be international, either way. That'S it thanks for watching this quick video review of the chromecast and I'll talk to you guys in the next one. """
fNt-QXLp6YI,Google Edition HTC One Review!,7:16,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kip PhD here, and this is the Google Edition HTC one now the regular HTC one was my favorite phones of this entire year. I gave it the number one choice in my top 5 1080p smartphones, it's just a brilliant phone all together, but now that there's a Google edition of this phone it's time to take a look at what sets this thing apart? What makes the Google Edition phone worthy or different from the regular HTC one? So without any further ado, let's take a closer look at the Google Edition HTC One. This device on the outside is basically exactly the same as the regular HTC One. You simply cannot tell the difference because well, there is no difference. The Google Edition one only comes in the silver 32 gigabyte model and everything that was great about the build quality of the regular HTC. One is still great about the Google Edition one as well. The aluminum body, the slight curves, the front-facing speakers, the zero gap technology, the front and back facing cameras, the sealed and battery even the Beats Audio logo, which we'll get to in a second all of that stuff is the same on this phone and up till now I could have been showing you a regular HTC One and you wouldn't ever known, but the real difference comes as soon as you turn on the phone because, as you know, the Google Edition HTC One is running a stock build with pure Android, the regular HTC One Is just getting the Android 4.2 update now with HTC Sense, but this Google Edition phone comes out of the box with the latest version of Android 4.2.2 and we'll get all the OS updates right behind Nexus devices very early, which is great. So all the differences that make this different from the regular HTC One are in the software department, so we'll go ahead and take a look at those. First of all, there are actually a new boot animation for the Google Play edition phones. This isn't a nexus boot animation right now. This is only found in the Google Play edition HTC One and galaxy s4. So that's pretty cool that that's new. Now, yes, this is booting into pure AOSP stock, Android, vanilla, Android, pure Android. However, you want to put it that is what comes onboard so no HTC Sense. Skin no carrier installed apps, no bloatware, just pure Android, because there's no HTC stuff, you actually do get some nice bonuses like that non expandable, storage space. You get more of it. Free out of the box - and he gets slightly better battery life with less blinkfeed and other HTC stuff running. In the background, some other things have changed too. First of all, I found this ROM to be overall a bit snappier when compared to HTC Sense, 5 and Sense. 5 was already really fast on the regular one. I think that's to be expected, though, by now with AOSP, it's just naturally a bit snappier and more fluid overall, and that's even more apparent with the google edition galaxy s4 when you compare it to TouchWiz, and I also think that stock Android happens to look really Pretty on the black bezel around the display, I just wish I could get a black google edition HTC one, since I think that would look even sexier. Now, of course, HTC Sense isn't all bad. In fact, some of the HTC ones - hardware specifically depended on optimizations from sense to be good, the speaker and the camera. Now the speakers are already huge, but, like I mentioned earlier, the Google Edition one still has a Beats Audio logo on the back and you're. Actually gon na find in the sound settings a Beats Audio toggle, so this device still has a dedicated, separate audio amplifier inside for those massive speaker, drivers and they've chosen to continue to label. It Beats Audio whether or not you decide to use it is up to. You have a listen to the difference in the sound it makes so. Beatsaudio is still in full effect here and I just leave it on all the time to avoid all the suppressions that come with turning it off I'll leave. My Beats Audio explained video in the description below that like button. If you're looking for any more information on that now, as far as the camera goes, this is still HTC's: 4 megapixel ultra pixel camera. I didn't explain video on this too, so I'll link that below, but basically because this only takes 4 megapixel shots. Htc had quite a few algorithms and tweaks in sense 5 for some sharpening and some optimization for low-light performance to make this look better in regular light after spending a lot of time with the device and looking at the photos, I've taken. It looks like a lot of these optimizations are still present, turns out they're, not all completely built into HTC Sense, but they're built into the imaging chip that is still part of the Google Edition ones. Hardware, like the Beats, Audio amplifier, so comes with the new Google camera software interface and swipe gestures to change, settings and everything. But the images you'll be able to take will look exactly the same, so you'll be able to switch to video mode, take HDR shots, panoramas and photo spheres, etc with Google, software and it'll have the same quality as a regular HTC One. So, of course, you're going to be missing all of HTC's extra little camera features like Zowie and the effects and live filters, but overall it is very fast and definitely not a bad, quick point-and-shoot camera for just the regular photo taking experience. So I think it's pretty obvious by now. I really like stock Android. I like the way it looks, and I prefer it over sense in just the way it operates, and I like how quick and responsive it is on hardware that is optimized for and as Google addition isn't just a regular HTC one with pure Android. On top of it, it actually has quite a few tweaks and adjustments behind the scenes to make it work for the one. The button layout is a good example on the bottom. It'S not on screen buttons, but you do get. You have to long press the home button to get to Google now and double tap it to get to multitasking, and that back button is always a back button, so no menu button down there. You still have to use on-screen menu button, but nothing else, switches about that. The bottom line here is it works. It has all those delicious hardware specs that make the HTC One the flagship of the year for HTC that info. So, at the end of the day, I really like the Google Edition hdc1 there were some initial concerns about whether or not stock Android would run fine on it, but, like we said there are some little behind the scenes. Improvements to stock Android that make this run really well on the one: it's not a nexus, obviously because of those you know, hardware, button layouts and it's slightly different, because there's no on-screen buttons, but I figure this would be a good chance to take a look at What native stock Android basically would look like on a phone when it's not CyanogenMod or anything like that now you can also download a Google Edition from for your HTC One, and you have one so I'll clue the links below to any of that stuff. If you want to check it out, if you're daring enough to route and flash something like that, but uh yeah at the end of the day, it's a great phone and I'm a fan, I'm going to be recommending it to a lot of people who, like stock Android, either way, thanks for watching this quick video be free to stay tuned, because the google edition galaxy s4 review is also in the works that will be coming up very soon either way. Thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys, the next one peace """
CntfUc_Sd1c,Nokia Lumia 925 Review!,8:38,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kay PhD here, and this is a Windows Phone 8 handset. This is the Nokia Lumia 925. A lot of people have asked me to review a Windows Phone 8 device, not just because it's Windows Phone 8, but because it's coming from the perspective of someone like me, who uses a lot of Google services, I use Google Tasks. Google Calendar Gmail a lot of things like that that make it really really good for Android. Now, Windows Phone 8 has come out and it's been around for a while, but I've never really tried it out, because I've never really seen all the customization and all the same functionality that I see in Android and anything about Windows Phone 8. But I'm gon na give it a shot. I gave it a full fair shot and I think it's important to note where I'm coming from and where I see this device from so that me further adue is good. Take a look at the Nokia Lumia 925. So, first of all, on the outside, this thing has pretty great hardware: it's up there in the top 5 best built smartphones. You can get right now, alongside the HTC One near the top seriously. It has zero, give zero flex and all aluminum ring around the outside Gorilla Glass, 2 on the front and technically a plastic back, but a very rigid, solid, build. It'S also rounded, on every single corner and the design is pretty nice and it has a slimming. Matte finish on that back, so basically, it's like a Lumia 920 on a diet, it's slimmer and thinner and more pocketable than its cousin in every single way, and it ends up making a beautifully sculpted device now in the specs Department. It'S interesting because this is supposed to be a flagship device right. Well, it doesn't have what we would think of as flagship specs. It has a 4.5 inch, 1280 by 768 AMOLED display a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4 processor, 1 gigabyte of RAM a 2000 million power battery. It'S kind of reminiscent of the galaxy s 2 to be honest, but even at its 1280 by 768 resolution, and all that it's it's fine, because Windows Phone and all of its apps. Yes, all of them trust me they'll work, just fine with what seems like mid-range specs for a phone in 2013, so that AMOLED display is actually pretty awesome. It'S 1280 by 768, but it comes in at 334 PPI. So it's a very high pixel density and, of course, since so much of Windows Phone is based around this color on black, you get a good look at those insane contrast ratios and deep blacks. You get from the display being AMOLED, it's also very readable outdoors too. Another thing about the design choice is that all of the buttons on this phone are on the right-hand side, so the volume rocker the power button and that dedicated camera switch are all on the right-hand side and I think that actually makes for a pretty compact easy To use device, you only really have to use it in one single hand where your thumb is, you can access every single one of these buttons, and I think it's also notable that there's that camera key because actually makes it feel like a really solid shooter. Even if you're not taking the best pictures in the world with this pure view, shooter on the back and the dedicated half press and full press to focus and take a picture, this camera button is is really solid and I think it adds that feel it brings Us back to like the 2010 LG Voyager style phones, where you always got that dedicated camera button and speaking of the camera. The back of this device is basically dedicated to exactly that: the decently loud speaker on the bottom and the camera. It'S an eight point. Seven megapixel PureView camera. Now I can't get into exactly how the proprietary PureView technology works behind the scenes when you're taking shots, but it is a pretty big deal to what Nokia is doing with this camera, but at the end of the day, this phone is a great walk-around camera. It takes sharp shots with nice. Contrast, solid amount of detail, pretty good low-light performance, I would say - and it also happens, to have really good stabilization. I noticed especially when zooming in and when taking video, but at the end of the day, it's about on par with any other high-end 8 megapixel camera, which makes sense, so the hardware is essentially a mid-range inside with beautifully sculpted externals. So how about that software? Well, it's alright! It'S alright! The Lumia 925, like we said, is running Windows Phone 8. The latest version and the operating system itself is pretty unique and a lot of ways that a lot of people will like. But it's also missing a lot of things that a lot of people have gotten used to having in other OSS, namely the apps. But we'll get to that in a second, so it's pretty minimalist style operating system overall, as you can see, pretty easy on the eye is very text heavy and overall, pretty easy to get used to using. It goes exactly as you'd expect everything does what you expect. It to so the ease of use factor is pretty great, and I could probably give this to my parents and they'd figure out most of it in about two seconds flat and in terms of style. It'S actually something I can see myself getting used to. If I sign a contract and had this going for a few years, of course, if you're not into red and black like - I am, you can always change the overall theme of the entire OS, with just a pair of flipped switches, which is pretty convenient. But that's as much customization as you're gon na get with these phones. So if you like making the device your own, like you really like making changes on any number of Android phones out, there you'll be a bit disappointed with the lack of UI changes. You actually can make, especially with your home screen in Windows Phone 8 in the home screen. Basically, besides changing the colors, you can only change the size and positioning of your tiles and what you decide to pin on your home screen. That'S about it! So some of the information you can see before you tap it. These are called live tiles and they give a bit of a dynamic look. But that's it! You can't change anything else about the home screen and next to that, you get your list of apps. So yeah I'm usually a person who likes tinkering around with the look of the Android. You know OS and home screens, and things like that. I got bored pretty easily in Windows Phone. I hate to say that, but, as I was taking around in Windows Phone, I found that this this device had a particularly impressive battery life I mentioned before. It only has a 2,000 milliamp hour battery, but thanks for that AMOLED display and the deep blacks made constant appearances in Windows Phone 8. I'M able to get some pretty impressive battery life, I would go to say, all-day battery and then a little bit more on. Only two thousand milliamp hours and that's because Windows Phone is really really effective and efficient and the standby times were outstanding. Standby times are great. I could put it to sleep with a hundred percent battery and wicked up the next morning and it would have 97 % battery, which was really really cool, but you'd expect a phone with such great battery life to sacrifice a bit on performance. Again. Windows Phone takes a lot at the helm here, and performance actually was usually pretty good. It was very responsive, especially with the slick Gorilla Glass 2 on the front, but this was a little bit dependent on the app, but that's the thing. The apps there are very, very few apps in the Windows Phone Marketplace and in fact I would go to say that this is this: is the killer right now? This is what kills Windows Phone for me. I could use Windows Phone for a while if I had to sign a contract, but the app support just isn't there. There are so many apps that I would use on iOS and Android that I just can't find. In fact, if you take a look through the Windows Phone Marketplace, you will see in the list of the top apps in the entire marketplace. It very quickly diminishes from you know, Angry Birds and the highest end developers straight down to like flashlights, and you know mini games and just terrible terrible apps in the top in the whole entire app store. So I mean this is not a great App Store at all. Again, the interface is fine, it looks fine, it functions perfectly, but it's just missing so many of the apps were used to having so overall it turns out that the Lumia 925 is a really nice Windows Phone flagship and definitely worthy and deserving of the Lumia tag. Now, if this phone was running Android, I probably carry it in a heartbeat. I am such a big fan of the outside of this phone and the design and the aesthetics and the build quality. Just like the HTC One, the Nokia of all the lumo Kia phones have in general, been really well built, but this one's a lot thinner and a lot more rounded and a lot more pocket-friendly than the previous Lumia bricks. So I really liked it Moe Kia, Lumia, 925 design and build and aesthetics and everything like that. But yeah there are a lot of decisions you have to make. If you want to decide to carry this phone or not that I've listed out in the review and the choice is yours, would you carry this phone? I think I'd. I think I'd be down either way thanks for watching. If you enjoyed this video for the give a thumbs up below that, definitely helps out, and the comment section is always open below you'll. Send me answering a ton of comments below there for any of the thoughts you guys might have to leave about the Lumia 925. Either way, thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next video. Yes, """
epLszn-rnpA,"13"" Macbook Air 2013 Review!",6:39,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm KB HD here, and this is a MacBook Air. Now, if I didn't tell you what year or model it was, you wouldn't really exactly know because on the outside, this is pretty much exactly the same as the previous year's model, but they dropped a lot of changes on the inside that make it a lot better. Now Apple's, not the only one to do this. A lot of other manufacturers have dropped as well chips in the latest generation of existing laptops and made them about a thousand times better. By doing so, but this is it, this is Apple's new machine. So, if had any further ado, it's time to give the full review treatment to the 2013 MacBook Air - and the first thing you notice is that literally everything on the outside of this laptop is exactly the same as the outside of the 2012 MacBook Air. It'S the same design same display same thinness, same ports, same hinge, same backlit keyboard, even everything's the same. The one thing that changed to be able to identify the new air over the old one is that microphone. So now there is a dual microphone port on the left hand, side all the other ports, however, on this MacBook Air are the same. The design has basically remained unchanged. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Considering the 2012 macbook air design isn't exactly bad. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people were hoping like me that the Retina display would come to this new machine. A really high resolution display, unfortunately Apple just refuses to make a retina MacBook Air anytime, soon they're, basically too busy protecting their retina macbook pro lineup, which sucks, but that's just Apple. So here we are with a 1440 by 900 panel which isn't bad at all. But if you're coming from using a device with a really high pixel density, you're, absolutely going to notice pixels, but outside of that this is still a pretty great laptop display, pretty standard with decent brightness and colors and viewing angles and the whole nine. I just wish it was at least 1080p whatever, so the outside of this machine is the same as the old one. So what's changed well, the story here is has well this machine. You'Re, looking at here comes with carrying Intel's fourth generation, Core i7 Haswell CPU clocked at 1.7 gigahertz with the Intel HD 5000 graphics inside, and this is really the only reason to buy this machine over any other one. Now Haswell CPUs have a seriously impressive power and heat management system that essentially double battery life. Now the MacBook Air was already mostly battery on the inside. It'S got a battery slightly larger than a lot of other ultrabooks measuring in at 7,000 150 milliamp hours. It'S pretty much the entire bottom of the machine these days, but with the new Haswell CPUs they're, estimated to last 12 hours of use on a single charge straight through that is actual all-day battery life computing. With this 30 inch model with heavy gaming or graphics work, or even some video editing, which this machine can actually handle, you'll see that life shift down to about five or six hours on his charge straight through, but lighter, not so intensive stuff. This machine will just keep going it's estimated, sometimes past 14 hours of battery remaining for me. So that's freaking awesome for a laptop now, there's also the 11 inch Haswell MacBook Air that my buddy Austin overide Duncan 3 303 is reviewing so I'll link. His review down below that like button, if you want to check it out, but that 11 inch air is supposed to get 9 hours on a charge as well. So you can thank Haswell for literally changing the way we use laptops because of that massive heat improvement. So thanks Intel now you would think with all these power conservation, this performance would drop through the floor. Well, not so again, Intel to the rescue. These clock speeds are already pretty solid. Like we said, this is the 1.7 gigahertz model and it benchmarks pretty well somewhere between the latest Mac Mini and the latest iMac, which is nice. So every day performance is still snappy, quick and efficient, which you would expect out of a laptop of this price, and there are also some other internal improvements that make that possible. First of all, a NATO 2.11 AC, Wi-Fi receiver is now in there for faster available wireless speeds and a PCI based SSD, delivering significantly faster, read and write speeds from the disk when compared to a SATA based SSDs of the older model. So you're going to get silly fast, opening and closing of apps and reading and writing them data. All that's going to happen at blazing fast speeds thanks that pci base SSD. So all in all it just made too much sense for Apple Apple is known for incremental improvements, and this is just the perfect incremental improvement for the MacBook Air, for them keep the same design the same body, same materials, same manufacturing process, but drop some Intel innovation In there with some, you know, PCI based SSD and some other minor improvements and reap the profits, because everyone loves 12 hours of battery. That is the main headliner for this machine, and I love it too. So it's almost as if Apple has delivered an extended version of the 2012 MacBook Air, where you get almost the same user experience, but it just lasts for much much longer on this new machine you're going to get a very friendly machine as well with again that Big glass trackpad, the all-metal construction, the solid, build quality, all the things you would expect out of a premium notebook over $ 1000. You pretty much get it with the macbook air. You can put windows on it. If you want, you won't get the same performance and you won't get quite the same battery life, but it'll still last pretty long time like a boss. Overall, it's a very friendly machine. I am a fan of the PC. I based SSDs. It'S something! I'Ve always really wanted in a mobile machine, and now we've got it so yeah. At the end of the day. This is basically in classic Apple style, the same machine as the previous generation with some minor tweaks inside, but that one minor tweak being the chip ends up making a huge difference now, in terms of who would buy this machine and who shouldn't. I personally can't quite stay with this machine because of one thing and that's the display: the display is 1440 by 900 on a 13-inch display, which is fine, that's ordinarily, great for most people, but coming from using a 2560 by 1600 display in the retina MacBook Air. I can't do it. I can't switch to being able to see pixels where I usually couldn't. So I'm going to keep sticking with the Retina display MacBooks and I'm probably going to be upgrading to the Haswell retina MacBook Pro the 13-inch when that comes out, because that seems like a logical upgrade for me, because my eyes are so used to a Retina display. But either way, let me know what would you pick? Would you pick a retina MacBook Pro, or would you rather have seen a retina MacBook Air or maybe would you get this regular, MacBook Air? Let me know down in the comments section right below that like button either way. Thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the neck Aysen you """
zb5Wp_i8oQo,Samsung Galaxy Mega Review!,7:29,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm KB HD here - and this is a six point - three inch phone. It'S a six point. Three inch phone, it's a bit of a test from Samsung to see how big of a device you and I are willing to keep buying. We bought the five inch Alex es4. We bought the 5.5 inch Galaxy Note. 2. How big are we willing to go with this? I'M gon na try to review this entire device without saying that's what she said once it's gon na be a bit of a challenge without any further ado. Let'S take a closer look at the Samsung Galaxy mega, so this is the mega 6.3 and obviously yes, it is gigantic, as you can see next to the galaxy s4, and it's really easy to say it's too big, even too big for a pocket, but it does Fit in my pockets, just fine and even in purses quite easily, obviously, but yeah, there's no other way to put it. This is the biggest smartphone out there right now, and it even makes the Galaxy Note 2 feel a bit small, and while a lot of people will immediately dismiss this phone as being way too big, there is a select group of people out there. Looking for something like this, a device - that's bigger than your typical smartphone, but pocketable, unlike the smallest of tablets, so this can take the place of both in your life, the smartphone and the tablet, and this galaxy mega actually does a pretty good job of that. For my experience now from a samsung point of view, this device is basically an experiment. They have that kind of money where they can put out some crazy new form factors, and if people like it and buy it, it'll keep doing it. If not, they won't they'll. Take a pretty big leap with the Galaxy Note and the Galaxy Note, 2 and people ate that up so they're, going even bigger. Now, with a 5.9 inch and a 6.3 inch Galaxy mega variant with the same looks as a galaxy s4, it's kind of like a vote with your wallet thing at this point. If people like it and buy it, Samsung will see that and we'll see more of this trend anyway, because this is such an experiment, the galaxy mega does not have flagship specs, because it's not a flagship. It has Android 4.2.2 inside, but it's running a quad-core Snapdragon 400 CPU at a 1.7 gigahertz clock speed and it scores a little more than half of what the galaxy s4 with the Snapdragon 600 does on quadrant. But luckily it doesn't need more than a whole ton of power, because while this display is massively huge, it is not 1080p. This is 1280 by 720 display, so it doesn't need nearly as much power to push around way less pixels. So you sacrificed a bit of pixel density for a much better performance on the chip, but the display still great actually colors, as you would expect, with a samsung amoled display, are very vibrant and viewing angles and brightness are still top-notch very good, and that adds to The media consumption experience on this tablet: / phone hybrid, it's much more fun - to watch youtube videos on this than anything else in Samsung's, Galaxy, lineup and speaking of that galaxy lineup. The mega is very similar to the galaxy s4 inside and out. It has a removable back to reveal a small speaker at the bottom, but it is pretty loud and there's also a micro SD card slot up top for expandable storage. Next to that 8 megapixel camera. And, of course, that brings us to one of the biggest advantages to carrying a mammoth of a phone like this battery life. This is the biggest battery in any phone 3200 milliamp hours, and it can go for a long time on a battery. It'S almost impossible to kill this thing in a day, even with heavy use, and there are some other advantages to having such a ridiculously Sasquatch gargantuan phone. One is that you get more information on the screen you just get more. It might not be 1080p. So it's not the sharpest thing in the world. Unfortunately, so text could use a little bit of improvement, but you can see so much in every app on the mega each and every app just looks bigger than it usually does on any other phone and the entire user interface scales and looks just mega sized. All of it looks huge and it doesn't even feel that tall. It feels more really wide apps, don't stretch anymore, obviously to take up the extra room, but they instead sit in the middle of the display, with tons of space on either side. It'S quite nice. Actually, this would be a great phone for someone with not very good eyesight or for someone with really large hands or large fingers or someone who wears big gloves all the time who knows, and just of course, if you feel like using this with one hand, samsung Added some of the single-handed features that it used in the galaxy note. 2, just in case, you feel the need to use this device with one hand for some of the apps, and yet another advantage of the huge display is the camera here. It feels like taking pictures with a tablet, but not really. If but the fact, the matter is with this display, it's so big that it kind of feels like you're, looking through a window at what you want to take a picture or video of and with the really solid, eight megapixel sensor in here likely the same optics As the galaxy s3, I've never had an easier time, composing shots and taking them on any other phone. No, I also do you want to say one of the biggest and most underrated advantages to having a larger screen on a phone is having a larger keyboard and believe me, when I say the on-screen typing experience on the galaxy mega 6.3 is oh, so good with Any keyboard, whether it's Google's or Samsung's, or a third parties, the fact that you have so much space for your fingers to move around and hit them keys. Oh man, it's a great time great time, texting and we're messaging on this thing. So basically, in summary, the Galaxy mega is a giant phone that enhances all the things that are good about having a great huge display, all the media, all the games and video watching it's all great thanks to the screen and since they took the galaxy s4 design. But the galaxy s3 specs it's a mid-range performer and definitely an interesting experiment from Samsung. It'S gon na fall in the same category as a galaxy. Note: 2, where people will stop you in public and ask you about your phone. It'S also in the same category where it takes a little bit of time to get used to the size, but once you get used to the mega, it can be an all-in-one device that replaces your tablet and your phone and really does give you the best of Both worlds with an all-day battery life that fits in your pocket and then of course. Lastly, what a lot of people ask me when they want to see what this phone is like. They want to know what it looks like held up to your ear when making a phone call, because people still make those not bad. I mean it's not quite as ridiculous as a tablet, but it's probably bigger than any other phone you've ever used either way. That'S been it, it's the Samsung Galaxy mega. I would say there's a lot to like about this phone, especially like we said the advantages of having such a big battery in such a big phone. Overall, all those advantages are still there, but I would still say that I prefer a 1080p display. I wouldn't recommend buying this phone only because this is the best look, we're gon na get at the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and when that phone does come out, it's going to have flagship specs. It'S gon na have top-of-the-line numbers, top-of-the-line, internals and externals and display, and that's going to make this phone look a little dull. But if you don't have the budget for the Galaxy Note 3, this is a great alternative and if you're looking for a big phone that lasts just all day on battery and then some Galaxy mega is a place to look. It'S a Samsung experiment and I think it's gon na sell interestingly either way thanks for watching this quick review video, if you enjoyed it, definitely feel free to give a thumbs up below and without any further ado I'll sign off here now - and I will talk to You guys in next one """
aYtAdCDOCfU,LG Optimus G Pro Review!,8:05,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm KB HD here - and this is the optimus G pro from LG. It'S LG's. First, entry into the phablet game, or the 5 inch or larger smartphone form factor category and they were smart and took a lot of cues from Samsung was very popular galaxy note, 2, and then they took some design improvements and some speck bumps and some overall hardware Upgrades and some software tweaks and basically turn it into the most accurate thing that we're going to see to the Galaxy Note 3, which isn't out yet, but this is probably the closest thing we're gon na see to that for a while. So without any further ado, let's take a closer video look at the lg optimus G pro. So this is a big phone, no doubt just like the Galaxy Note 2 and has a lot of similarities with its Samsung counterpart. But then each aspect is slightly improved. Just slightly so, you can start with the build. Both phones are made of plastic, but the optimus G pro on one hand feels a little bit more compact in the hand it has a slightly narrower body while maintaining that 5.5 inch display and that's because the bezel is twice as thin. As on the note 2, the Optimus also has a removable back, of course, which reveals a slightly larger battery coming in at 3,140 milliamp hours, a tiny bit larger than the one in the note 2, and this thing lasts just as long on a charge. I'M talking full weekend, roadtrip companion. This is a road warrior, just like the note. Also behind that back cover are, of course, the SIM card tray. Any micro SD card slot for expandable storage and up top is the slightly unimpressive speaker, probably the most unimpressive part of the whole phone. It'S a bit small and it could easily be covered up with a single finger, but you also get the 13 megapixel camera up there, which we'll get to in just a second other than that, though, just about everything about the Optimus G pros, build quality is nearly As good as it gets on a phone of this size, I mean we've never seen a phablet, that's made of metal. So obviously, this is as well built as a phone that you can probably get from top to bottom in that form factor and also the home button that doubles as a notification LED is a nice touch. The LED colors are great now flanking that home button are the menu and back buttons, but LG's just flip them around so they're the opposite of all those Samsung devices out there. So it took me a little while to get used to, but here's the back button on the left and the menu button on the right. I guess, if you're gon na change, something just for the sake of changing it, it might as well be something small like that. But all around this phone feels about the same as the Galaxy Note. 2, just slightly different in a lot of ways, and then you get to turning it on and the first thing you notice, even more than that display is LG's. Weird lockscreen totally blows my mind every time I use it, but there it is and that the biggest difference once you turn it on is LG's display. Here we have a 5.5 inch, 1080p full-hd super IPS display. As we know, the galaxy note. 2 has a 720p display, so this display has excellent color reproduction clarity, sharpness viewing angles, brightness everything about it. It'S a very good panel and I love the bezel. I love the fact that it's so thin. It really makes this phone's display stand out. It seems like that's the highlight of this phone, and it should be it's probably one of the best aspects of it. I was initially concerned about the panel's impact on battery life, thinking that a different display would have a very different battery life but, like I said before, this one had no problem lasting two full days on a battery charge with normal use. So that's just a breeze to handle anyway, the next biggest difference and the biggest thing you'll notice about the optimus G pro is LG's skin on top of Android 4.1.2 LG next to motorola, and maybe Oppo have probably the most unconventional, far out stock Android skin of Any phone manufacturer today, obviously the lockscreen - is one big change, but you'll notice, just about everything about this phone outside of the lockscreen has changed too. You can see where they took Kim's from the note to the default time and weather widget is an obvious one, not too hard to see the similarities there, and also, instead of Samsung's multiple windows running next to each other. Lg has qslide, which is one app that can be toggled transparent on top of the other. Lg also has a tabbed menu structure that lets you swipe through the menus, thank goodness, but they also let you switch between the tabbed and just a full list of all the settings. The default is the tab structure, but I kind of like that they give you the choice to just get that full list. If you don't really want to drill down over, although it's Android and you can customize it to look like basically whatever you want, you make it look. However, you feel, but a lot of the elements of LG's custom skin, like the credit notification panel, for example - are unavoidable. Like every single time you pull down the notification panel, it's half full of things like you know, toggles, and a slider for brightness and a whole bunch of different stuff. There are also a ton of pre-installed apps, like more than any other phone I've ever used. Now I'm using the 18 T version here, but obviously there's not going to be tons of pre-installed apps on the international version, but there is definitely a lot of stuff that came on the phone. But overall I like that this phone is such a great performer. It'S that's to be expected, of course, with the Qualcomm Snapdragon, 600 quad-core processor inside obviously, one of the best processors you can put in a phone but yeah. This thing is a great performer and constantly surprised me with how snappy and smooth the experience was using. It. Probably a little bit snappier then at the galaxy note. 2. So that's definitely a good sign. But overall this is definitely an lg phone. Lg really made it an LG experience and you can see how many cues they took from Samsung both in the software and the hardware. Of course, the note 2 has one of the best eight megapixel cameras in any smartphone, but the Optimus G pro shooter is 13 megapixels, so it takes slightly more detailed shots thanks to that extra resolution, but nothing all that crazy. It'S also not very contrasting, so you lose a bit of that dynamic range and it's not quite as vibrant as Samsung's color in photos and videos from this camera. You also don't get the same interface or the same crazy features that Samsung throws in there. But overall it's not a bad camera at all and you won't be disappointed with it. Actually, the 1080p videos it takes are really quite good in any kind of light, and I found myself taking pretty much everything in full auto because Auto does a great job on this phone, so props to LG for that so yeah. If I had to describe the Optimus G pro in one word, it would be LG because this phone is so LG. It'S full of LG in every imaginable way everywhere that there's room for an LG touch. You can expect an LG touch, and these you know these LG touches are all shots, attempting to one-up the Galaxy Note 2, and I love that it's the competition that drives us forward, and this is basically the Galaxy Note. 2.5. So, in the end, the Optimus G pro is an phone definitely LG's best. Yet it's great in all the same ways that the Galaxy Note 2 is great. You consider it a small sidestep or even a slight upgrade from the galaxy note. 2 again, we don't know what the Galaxy Note 3 is gon na look like, but this is probably your best bet for an upgrade from the note 2. If you want to stay in that phablet form factor and even get a slightly better phone, you know we have a bigger battery. You have a higher resolution. Camera you have a 1080p display. You have a whole bunch of improvements in here, so this is LG's best phone, yet I would definitely recommend it if you're into the LG skin. I personally wouldn't go for it as my daily driver, just because some of the animations don't quite feel right. Some of the software I'm not a fan of - and I don't happen to be - a huge fan of the looks of LG's skin on top of Android that could change soon. But for now it's a good phone on the hardware front and it's getting there with the software either way. That'S been it. Thank you for watching this review of the Optimus G pro. I hope you enjoyed.

KF75-HPdUfY,HTC One Review!,11:37,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm KB HD here and I recently did a top 5 1080p smartphones, video and this device ended at number 1, so it took crown 4 best. 1080P smartphone and I've also been tweeting about, and talking about this phone a lot - and this is it this is time to give it the full review treatment. This is the review of the HTC One, so the one is a really interesting phone this year. For a couple of reasons, number one - this is HTC's main flagship, so it seems like it's their last hope - and this is a bit of a must-win phone for them number, two, its competing directly against Samsung's flagship, the galaxy s4 for sales and that's interesting because HTC Actually took some serious risks with this phone that you don't usually really see in other phones and some of them. You already know what I'm talking about already but I'll get to those in a second, but initially picking up this phone and holding it is a pretty nice experience, which is pretty obvious. It'S an all metal, unibody aluminum back design, which kind of wraps around to the front. It'S definitely not the thinnest phone in the world and it's also definitely not the lightest phone in the world either, but it feels rather steadily built and that's always a good thing. In fact, this is probably one of the best things about this phone: how hefty it feels in the hand it feels really good and how well everything fits together with that back piece of metal. Now some people have had small gaps appear between the layers of the phone and sometimes it's worse than others, but my phone, my HTC One, feels pretty much perfect. So that's always good. The one thing about the outside Hardware of the HTC - One that I don't like is the button placement, mostly the power button placement. So the power button is up at the top left hand corner, which is a little bit awkward. But if you hold your phone with your left hand, you can get to it and go to the phone with your right hand, you can get to it, but I'm just so used to tapping our right hand. Side for power like I did on. You know Samsung and Motorola devices that it kind of gets me throws me off a little bit and there are no buttons on the left hand, side of the phone there's just the SIM card tray and on the right hand side. Is your volume rocker, no power button and, speaking of all the placement, I guess we'll go over at the top - is also your three-and-a-half millimeter headphone jack and at the bottom, is your USB port and now at the front you have some awesome. Awesome design features going on here and and then some other, not so awesome ones, but first of all, you have a 4.7 inch 1080p display coming in at shy of 470 pixels per inch. It is an extremely extremely nice display, then down at the bottom. You have your HTC logo and just two buttons capacitive buttons, your home button and your back button, and you also have your boomsound front-facing speakers, which we'll also talk about in a second there's, also a wide-angle front facing camera and the holes for the boomsound speakers are Micro, drilled, they're really really high quality, they look pretty good and I was also a notification light up top. So overall the front I like the design of this phone, it's kind of a two-tone design, which is you know, a mixed bag. Some people don't like it because it looks like an iPhone, but honestly, I think it has a pretty unique appeal of its own on the back. Of course, you also have that band. The plastic bands are where the antenna signals were go through. That'S where NFC will happen, that's where your radios and Bluetooth and everything will go through. Basically, you can't go through the metal. Then you also have your four ultra pixel camera in your flash and you have your AT """
wXmzpFoHkfA,Samsung Galaxy S4 Review!,10:39,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm Kay PhD here and the Samsung Galaxy s4 - will easily be one of the most popular phones of 2013, no doubt and when Samsung builds up that much hype for any phone like they do with the s4, especially when the predecessor, the S3 is so popular. We kind of expect the s4 to be a really good phone, and a lot of people see the Galaxy s4 as an evolutionary update to the galaxy s3, and understandably so, because of the naming. But after my time with it, I'm seeing it a bit differently, I'm seeing the galaxy s4 as more of a downsized reconstructed. Note to hear me out so the galaxy s4 is more square than the galaxy s3 first of all, and although it has very similar dimensions, Samsung will tell you that it's slightly thinner and slightly lighter. So that's true, but you won't really notice these differences if you're familiar with the galaxy s3. You also feel right at home with the button layout and the port layout, because they're the same on the galaxy s4 and they're, also the same as they are on the galaxy note. 2. But overall, the phone just looks and feels just different different in the way. The Galaxy Note 2 feels different from the s3, mostly because this design again it's more square and then you check out the insides. You already know that you can take off the back: the thin, flexible plastic back of the galaxy s4 to reveal the internals, and that will reveal a removable, 2600 milliamp hour battery and a micro SD card slot and the speaker, micro, SIM card, etc. Now compare this to the galaxy s3 on the left and the galaxy note 2 on the right, and there is even more reason to consider the s4. A restructured note to the speaker is now down in the bottom. At the same place, the battery is also now lower in the chassis and the microSD card, and micro SIM card slots are now above the battery. Instead of below all these, like the note 2, not the s3, also on the galaxy s3, the edges were so tapered that you had no real edge of the phone to grip, and that was a bit of a problem for me, but with the new s4 design, You actually have that metallic band around the phone that creates an edge to grip before the tapering starts. It'S a small touch and it's something. A lot of reviewers look past as a cheap attempt to look more premium, but it actually really changes the feel of the galaxy s4 in the hand you hold it so, on the hardware side of things, consider this guy a compacted Galaxy. Note! 2! That'S just the way it feels in the hand and the way it's built on the software side of things, though this is familiar Samsung territory. So here on the galaxy s4, we have an updated TouchWiz on top of Android 4.2 jelly bean this time. So, first of all, since it's Android 4.2, now you get a bunch of new google features like, for example, the quick settings in the notification bar that Samsung, so generously, colorized and added to they're accessible with a two finger swipe down from the top of the notification Bar and you can basically customize them to let you one tap toggle any feature on the phone which is actually kind of nice. It'S convenient and you also get Android 4.2 S lock, screen widgets and the first one. I install it as dashclock, of course, because it's beautiful, but yeah plenty of apps are supported. You can swipe to the right to open the camera or swipe to add more lock screen widgets there. A welcome addition that the Galaxy s3 and note 2 don't have yet and then there's the rest of TouchWiz. So Samsung stuffed this phone to the gills with software features inside of TouchWiz. A lot of them will make for great commercials and gimmicky tricks and neat demos. So this one is very demo able, which is very good for Samsung, but in the end a lot of these features probably won't be used by the average user. So, for example, air view is new. It lets you hover your finger over an album in the gallery to get a preview of the photos inside it's useful. It works, but it's an extra gesture. You have to learn and people are used to just tapping in an opening gallery anyway. So I don't know if people will use that there's also things like smart scroll and smart stay and smart pause and all this smart stuff, that's supposed to basically read your eyes using a front-facing camera and take action or adjust itself. Accordingly, they all work most of the time, but if you have them on by accident - or you don't want them to be on, you may find your phone scrolling up and down or pausing videos or changing orientation by itself when you didn't want or need it to Do that so I ended up turning these features off after a while. They got annoying and I just didn't need them, and I did an explanation. Video of all these things so I'll leave a link right below the like button on this video. If you want an explanation of all the galaxy s4 software features, but basically overall TouchWiz has a lot of new added features that are like. I said great for demos, it's great for showing off to your friends or something like that, but eventually I turn them off because they just weren't doing it. For me, I don't really need them overall, though TouchWiz is still very colorful, as we've seen on other devices and very very contrast II, just like on the galaxy s3 and the note 2 and touch which is very contrasting because it's also on that M OLED display And speaking of that display, this is no ordinary AMOLED display. The galaxy s4 is rocking a 1920 by 1080 Super AMOLED plus display, so that gives it a pixel density of 441 pixels per inch and it does have a pentile sub pixel matrix. But nobody can tell this display has far more pixels in that 5 inch space than any naked eye can decipher, and that means razor sharp text images, video everything I love it, it's what we've been waiting for it, which what we knew was coming in the upgrade To the s4 - and it is the number one reason to upgrade to this phone from something like the galaxy s3 now, because it's an AMOLED display. It also has a few advantages over other 1080p phones, for example, in deeper blacks, higher contrast and lower power consumption. But all of that comes with the trade-off that this display is no brighter than the galaxy s3, so it kind of struggles in daylight when compared to something like the HTC One, but that's of course another video. Now it's pushing these pixels with the Snapdragon 600 processor. In the United States, which, if you don't know, is an absolute tank of a processor, just a performance monster, benchmark killer and all-around great chip, so it's going to score really high on pretty much any benchmark that you put it through, and it's also going to get You great power consumption as well, so I was able to get all-day battery life again about the same battery life as the galaxy s3. With the stock battery, I was using the galaxy s3 on Verizon, which was an LTE network, and I was using the galaxy s4 on AT """
LDBWrSENTps,Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro Review!,5:58,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kay PhD here - and this is my full review of one of my newest favorite pairs of headphones under $ 200, the Bayer dynamic custom, Pro ones and they're my favorites for a lot more than the fact that they have red in black. On them, but I haven't done headphone reviews in a while. So if you want to see more headphone reviews or similar lower budget accessories and things like that, definitely the thumbs up below or comment. If you have more suggestions, but let's go ahead and dive right into this, these are the Bayer dynamic custom Pro one headphones and they kind of came into my world out of nowhere in the past month and just became my daily driver over the ear headphones, which Is kind of a big deal for me for a while I've hailed, the a THM 50s by Audio Technica, as my favorite headphones under $ 200, buy a lot for a long time. If you want to watch that infamous review, I guess you can check out that link right below the like button on this video. But you can thank TLD today for introducing me to these very dynamic cans, as they've surprised me quite a bit in a really good way. Headphones are catching up to the M 50s now, and this one is what I've seen the leader of the pack. First of all, these headphones look good and I don't say that about a lot of headphones. There are a lot of very ugly headphones out there, but these actually look really good. Like beats Pro good sexy, some might say now: I'm not just saying this, because they have a little bit of red and black. In fact, you can actually customize the plates on these. The entire look to make them look like a totally different set of headphones. Hence the name the custom, so you can really do whatever you want with these, the velcro on the top is changeable and everything I chose all black with the red accents, but these are also sexy for more than just the color, but also the materials used and The overall form and function and the feel of these headphones, they honestly stand out to me of some of the best-looking ones now. The second reason to love these over the eight ehm 50s is features. These have two very specific features that are better than or at least are not included on the 80 HM 50s. First is the removable headphone cable. It comes with a cable, that's about three feet: long and it's very manageable, but at the end, is a removable, headphone jack with a slot that actually plugs into the bottom of the left side of the headphones. So that makes them actually really versatile. If you break the cable, you can replace it with a new one, and I've actually seen them with a movable microphone attachment. So you can attach an inline microphone, and that makes these now you know gaming headphones. You can use them for Skype or phone calls or gaming. Whatever else you want to do, which is cool, I wouldn't use it for that, but it's definitely a value, adding feature and then the second awesome feature that separates it. From my favorites, the m50 s are the base port. Now this is a port at the bottom of each can on the bottom of these headphones. That are a seriously unique feature that almost no other pair has it's basically a slider that adjusts how much these headphones respond to bass or the low frequencies. The more open the port is, the more bass you have in your sound now, a lot of people will cry. This is BS that does not work. Is this effective? Does this actually make a difference in the sound? Yes, it actually does, and not only can I hear it boom here - is a graph of the frequency response with the different positions as you notch forward and as you can see halfway down open is where I keep it and that's approximately the most balanced sound and That'S where it sounds close to the m50 s. Actually, so I got used to the sound, pretty quick, but this is a seriously awesome feature say you're listening to jazz and you just want to accentuate. You know the vocals and you want to concentrate on the highs and mids of the instrumentals, so you switch over to closing all of the baseboards and you hear all that and then you switch over to listening to. You know Skrillex on Pandora and you just open up the bass board and unleash the full rockin bass that these things are capable of. Just with the flick of a switch. I mean that's some serious versatility right there. That is a killer feature of these headphones. So yeah these guys are good-looking enough to have some unique features and be really compelling - and I have switched over to these as my full-time editing and music listening over ear headphones from the EM 50s, and I don't regret it at all. These guys are comfortable, flexible and pretty soft, so they will fit in just about any size head. They don't fold the same way that the m50 s do and they're also not as flexible. So I guess they're not really portable because they don't come with a can or a way to port them, but then again the m50 s are ridiculously stretchy. So I wouldn't expect any other parrot to live up to that. But I do like the fact that these guys are fairly compact without having to fold them. One thing to note is that these actually do have to be burned in a little bit. They didn't sound, fantastic out the box, but they do sound pretty good now. So if you do get these just lay them on a table play some music for a couple of hours, maybe overnight, maybe for a day or two and you'll you'll gradually start to hear the sound stage open up and they'll really start to pop. Now I can't go into audio file level detail on the sound, but I've been listening to these without an amp for a while, so they sound really good. Without an amp they're pretty sensitive and like I said they sound similar to the EM 50s, when the bass port is half open, so you get very deep, rich lows, but they're still detailed enough to have plenty of room for the mids and the highs. An overall. Very balanced, sound works well in a lot of situations, but really being able to play around with your sound and the bass. Port is something that I'm going to start looking forward to in future headphones bottom line. I recommend these. The bass port is a ton of fun to play around with the link below. Has your price and they're in the same ballpark as the EM 50s. So it's definitely an option. You really can't go wrong with these or either set for that matter, but I guess it's just a matter of which one, you think looks better, so go ahead and pull the trigger and you won't regret it. These are the Bayer dynamic custom one Pro headphones. Thank you for watching I'll talk to you guys in the next video and don't buy the Facebook phone peace. You """
GlhXpHULwys,Sony Xperia Z Review!,8:13,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kay PhD here, and this is the Sony, Xperia Z and this little slab of metal and glass. Here I found to be the most mixed bag of all time. Allow me to explain when your Sony you're going out to make the high-end super phone to compete with the likes of the Galaxy Note 2 and the Droid DNA and other super high-end devices. You'D go all out right, you would add. You know high-end materials, high-end, build quality, high-end, internals high-end software. The whole works. That'S what you expect when you get the Sony, Xperia Z, so taking a look at the body itself, it's definitely sexy. You can't take that away from it, it's 7.9 millimeters thin and it's got a piano black glass finish on the front and the back. So it's nice there's a 13.1 megapixel rear facing camera and LED flash on the back and all around the phone has a pretty solid button. Layout power button itself is a great button. It'S really big and easy to press and not too sensitive, which is nice, doesn't go off in your pocket, so the whole right hand. Side is basically the power button, the volume rocker, which is less easy and the SIM card tray and, on the left hand side. You have your micro SD card slot, which is covered, but that allows for expandable storage, so they notice that all around this device, all the ports, are covered and sealed by plastic flaps. This isn't actually a bad thing. This is a good thing because when all these flaps are closed, the spare uz is water resistant for up to half an hour in three feet of water. So this thing is actually a bit rugged. They were demoing it just like that at CES. So, if you ask me, is a pretty tough device. Every single important thing about this device has something hugely awesome about it and something hugely disappointing about it. Everything about this device so starting, let's take take a look at the camera. It'S half awesome with a thirteen point. One megapixel sensor extremely fast performance. I noticed it takes pictures and burst shots very very quickly and it can take 1080p HD, our video, so the capabilities are really high and the very intelligent and fast autofocus is really pleasing. But it's it's pretty versatile, yet the images it produces, especially for landscapes, tend to be pretty soft, with a below-average LED flash performance and overall, not the best image quality, something comparable with the Galaxy Nexus. So, on the software side of things, this guy is running Android. 4.1, jelly bean. So that's not bad! No word on the 4.2 update, but that is pretty pretty recent and the positive side is that this is one of the less obtrusive skins on any Android 4.1 device out there. So that's a good start. That'S a good sign! There'S also not a whole lot of Sony bloatware, not a whole lot of bad pre-installed apps like we see on Verizon phones, so that's pretty good and the value adding features are definitely welcome. However, I am NOT a fan of the light gray software buttons at the bottom and in the notification bar. I would have preferred these to be, I guess, darker, to match the black bezel or lighter to be like more transparent, but that gray is just really awful in between and that theme kind of permeates throughout. So you might not think it's ugly, but there's definitely room for improvement with design here and then there's performance. This thing in terms of performance flies actually can't take. Anything away from the performance frame rates are constantly high. The thing just powers through the most intensive apps and games without a problem and that's thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro chip and two gigabytes of RAM. So it's a quad-core thing and this just flies and of course kills benchmarks and you can check out how it crushes through data when browsing more image-heavy sites like the verge. It'S very well done, but basically overall performance is stellar on par with the galaxy note 2, and it's just about as good. If you don't count the huge battery in the note 2, but then you have to look at that display now. The Sony, Xperia Z has a 1080p display. Yes, it does 440 PPI, but that is kind of becoming the mega pixel count number and it's extremely sharp and beautiful when you view it head-on and if you're going to be spending a lot of time on a high-end smartphone like this, you do want it to Have a sharp big, beautiful display because you're doing all your looking on the display? Unfortunately, the good ends there, it's kind of like having a 37 megapixel camera that doesn't take great photos when you look at this display from even a few degrees off-axis. The viewing angle is the color reproduction. The contrast just goes straight downhill, you don't even have to have it side by side with an oppo find five or a droid DNA to notice that this display is subpar. I mean it's definitely not that good. I haven't personally looked at the HTC one's display, but from the specs that I've seen I'm expecting it to be really good. So it's going to be hard to compete, and this thing just it lets me down. I'M really disappointed viewing angles are the most disappointing. I couldn't have asked for anything worse than this literally just a few degrees off-axis and it's noticeably worse, and then there is the speaker. This is this is a terrible speaker, in fact I'll. Let you have a listen for yourself, so this fair easy has its ups and it's downs like it. Has it's really really high ups and it's really really far downs. I know it's going to be hard to compare this to the HTC One and the Droid DNA, but it's going to be compared with those 1080p phones. It'S going to be compared with the Galaxy s4 and anything else high-end that comes out this year. But the comparison is really crazy when you try to put a semi rugged, water-resistant, but also thin and elegantly designed own up against something. That'S just going all out in one department. You may love this very Ozzie and I wouldn't blame you. This thing is sexy, but a lot of people are going to pick it up just for the design which itself is okay but definitely think twice about what you want in a phone and what you don't want in a phone before throwing down a cache. So, in the end, what is the deal with the Sony? Xperia Z? It is the biggest mixed bag ever this one has so many things that are good about in so many things that are bad about it. Now, if it was all bad or all good, it will be easy to not recommend this phone or to recommend this phone. But you really have to pay attention to the goods and the bads and pick what you like about it and what you don't like about. It and if they match up with your values, you might still go for the spare uz, but for me they don't align perfectly with the things that I've gotten used to enjoying about a phone. That being said, I still love the pixel density of a 1080p display and I'm excited for the Wars of the 5-inch 1080p smartphones this year or even the HTC One, which is a slightly smaller than 5-inch screen and it's 1080p. So I like the fact that we're seeing more 1080p phones now, but honestly, it's just getting to that point where you got to make it good. If you're going to have a 1080p display on a phone, it has to be a great display and for the price point, this is just such a hard recommend. You really have to look at your values. Also another interesting fact - and I guess a bit of a disclaimer is this phone comes out of the box with a screen protector in the box, but it also comes with a very subtle screen protector already applied on the phone. It takes up the entire slab of glass and these sony branding on the front of the spare uz is actually attached to the screen protector. So if you take it off, it'll just be a perfectly blank black slab, which is kind of cool, but that screen protector is probably the cause of some of the issues I have with the display. But honestly, it's a little bit weird that you can't even really tell that the screen protector is applied, but I wouldn't take it off of the display because taking it off would mean pretty much exposing that lists then up to par display to the elements and if You'Re going to have a ruggedized phone you're, probably going to want to leave that on which of course brings up the question: is this a slick, beautiful design, well phone designer phone? Or is this a really tough rugged, water-resistant phone because it's really hard to be both and I guess Sony tried to be both and that's where they ended up having some contradictions in those phone either way the choice is yours. Do you like this very easy? I think it's sexy, but again it's all up to you leave a comment down below the like button on this video and the comment section is open. So you probably see me replying to comments down there either way. Thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next video you """
6d0lEMp8Vtk,Chromebook Pixel Review!,7:56,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm KB HD here - and this is the Chromebook pixel easily one of the most confusing products of the first half of 2013 and one of the most difficult to review, because so many of the products we look at all the time are Geared for consumers, this one is not anyway in terms of pure aesthetics. This thing is awesome: it's made of an aluminum chassis and has a very squared off design. In fact, it bears some resemblance to the 13-inch retina MacBook Pro in more ways than one, but that's probably a good thing, because they both look pretty good and the design is all topped off. With this sweet light bar that Google says is included simply because it looks cool and it does, the design is so understated, otherwise that the light bar is an awesome but subtle lighting effect. That brings the other the whole Google design like a boss. It'S a nice! Looking accessory and outside of that, it's a very handsome notebook again, we like the aluminum unibody stuff and the port layout is also pretty basic. We have some USB ports, we have an SD card reader, but all that is to be expected from a basic laptop. Now, if I were to recommend a Chromebook to anyone, I recommend the 64 gig LTE model, but this here is a Wi-Fi, only version. So it's a 32 gigabyte pixel. Even so, if I spend $ 1300 on a laptop any laptop, it better. Have a nice keyboard, a nice trackpad and nice display might better heat. You know nice build quality, the whole nine I expected the most when you go over $ 1,000 and the Chromebook pixel actually does deliver that. So this Chiklis style keyboard is very comfortable to type on with. You know: big hands small hands. It has just a tiny bit of flex in the center, but it's not too bad, and the speakers are incredible. Like mind-blowing ly good, they happen to be invisible because they're hidden beneath the keyboard, but they are really really loud. So you can watch a movie literally in a loud environment with them and they'll be loud and crisp and clear, they're, awesome and the trackpad is also magnificent. This large, smooth, matte black trackpad, is pleasing to the eye and very pleasing to use it's nice and smooth and it completes the laptop experience and then, of course, it's called the Chromebook pixel because of that display. So this guy is rocking a pretty noteworthy display. It'S a twelve point: eight five inch 2560 by seventeen hundred display, which makes it noteworthy for a couple of reasons. 1. This is the highest pixel density display on any laptop at 239 PPI. It also is noteworthy because of the brightness 400 nits very bright display. It'S extremely sharp and crisp and clear. It'S also noteworthy because it's a 3 by 2 aspect ratio which makes it taller than your typical 16 by 9 net laptops that were used to, but then again you're building a machine for the web. So every single web, page Scrolls vertically so you're actually getting some generous extra vertical pixels in there, even if you do get some letterboxing with movies, so that extra screen real estate is welcome and it's noteworthy because it's a touchscreen now I have very mixed opinions about Touch screens on laptops, my number one problem with them is usually how much the hinge wobbles when I try to touch the screen on the pixel is no exception. So I found myself holding the back of the display in place. While I use the other hand on the touchscreen, but I can still use the keyboard to type regular things, but the other problem is the lack of anything touchscreen, optimized and Chrome. Os is no exception, at least right now. A lot of people express the desire for this device to run Android in one of my previous videos in the comments section, and that seems to make sense, but I'll get to that in a second. So speaking of Chrome OS, how is the operating system? Well, it's very similar to what we've seen on those cheaper 200 and 250 dollar Chromebooks, and probably the web browser you're watching this in right now this is a pretty advanced version of Chrome. Os, though - and it has some neat tricks to make, it feel like a little bit more than just a web browser first of all, multiple window action is always nice and window management is now built-in and it works well. There'S also this bar at the bottom. That feels like the dock in Windows 7, where you can pin and launch your applications, and you can also auto hide it too, with just a swipe. So that's nice, there's also a setting strafe floating at the bottom right hand corner, and this gives you quick access to settings and things like volume, Bluetooth, etc. Kind of like Android was for tablets, and I can see this going further into that direction in the future. As a performer, the pixel was pretty solid. In fact, it felt like it was overall a bit more stable than the Chrome Beta is for my desktop and a few benchmarks, pretty much confirm that it scored a lot higher on browser mark than the cheaper Chromebooks, but still less powerful than the hackintosh pro. That runs Google Chrome, also, of course, since its Chrome OS and boots superfast, and it wakes from sleep instantaneously and all that stuff. You can go pretty much from a cold boot to surfing internet. In a matter of seconds. Battery life is again very average for a laptop of this size coming in at about five-and-a-half hours from my use, but watching a movie on that display could kill it a bit faster at maximum brightness. But honestly, this is like the ultimate grandma surf the web machine, though it feels very much like a beta product pinch-to-zoom, for example, is buried in the settings in chrome flags, but once it's enabled you can start playing around with it. You can see it works pretty. Well, on a lot of sites, scrolling is 100 % smooth all the time. It'S actually common to see that core i5 and its integrated graphics hiccup a little bit when trying to scroll down really big sites, but for the most part, websites loaded quickly and scrolling and zooming was a pleasure. So you can tell it really. You can tell really easily which parts of websites aren't Retina display optimized with certain graphics and things like that. But text always looks good whenever you zoom in on text on this display. It looks extremely crisp and sharp from any viewing distance. So really, my only complaint about the Chromebook itself would be that it gets a bit warm sometimes when using it for a long period of time, and sometimes that display is just a bit too glossy. The reflections might get annoying and daylight, but outside of that, it's arguably the best hardware in the business right now, but not Google. Now Google has like a really massive task ahead of them to get chrome OS up to speed and to get the Chrome OS webstore up to speed. Even though Google Drive can replace Microsoft Office and a lot of the webstore apps are really well done right now. Apps, like Photoshop and video editing apps, for example, and native software, are really irreplaceable. Still and most people would opt for something running Windows or OS 10 over a Chromebook every time, because the ability to run native apps but Google I'll tell you something right now. If you want to make a little money, yeah I'll, let you in on a secret, if you give the Chromebook pixel the ability to run Android apps, prepare yourself to sell out, because that would be a real unlocker of the potential of this machine. But in the end it is really difficult to summarize the Chromebook pixel in any sort of concise way. But basically I would say it goes back to the explained - video that I did a couple of days ago. I'Ll have a link right below the like button on this video or you can click the annotation right there. But this is basically the definition of a a lo product and I would say, as a summary, this is a beautiful piece of engineering, a really good-looking solidly built piece of hardware that you should never buy. That being said, definitely go watch the explained video, because this is the real definition of a halo product right here and it's something that will basically be a beacon of light and shine the way forward as a sort of an inspiration for where Google wants their partners To go now so, like we said, we've seen lots of very cheap $ 250 $ 200 Chromebooks. Now that have proven that Chrome OS can be great for a basic, cheap computer, but Google is trying to shine the way for high-end Chromebooks and basically we'll just see how it goes from here. So that's the Chromebook pixel guys, thanks for watching, definitely be sure to subscribe. If you want to see more videos like this, it's definitely helps out a lot and if you leave a thumbs up, that's also very helpful. Either way. Thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys, the next one you """
XkqiFOvF8v0,Oppo Find 5 Review!,10:09,"A what is up guys, I'm Kay PhD here, and it's about time. We give the full review treatment to the Oppo, find five. So for those of you who missed it. My first video about this device is on the screen now and an annotation, or it's the first link below the like button on this video, but, to put it bluntly, we've been waiting for this phone for a while. This is the International fine, five from Oppo a company more well known for its pricey blu-ray players. But boy has the thing been a pleasant surprise in the build quality department. This is the best smartphone. You can buy step aside droid DNA step aside, Samsung plastic step aside, iPhone 5 step aside lumia 920. This is a stormtrooper of a smartphone build an absolute boss. It measures in at a hundred sixty five grams in 8.8 millimeters thick, so that's actually making it thinner and lighter than that 920, but not too thin and not too light. I actually prefer a phone. That'S just a little bit thicker to accommodate a bigger battery and they've done that with this phone it has a 2,500 million power battery inside the sky, so that'll help it last easily an entire day on a charge which is nice. Now I'm not about to do a drop test, but this phone feels incredibly well built. In fact, the frame is made of steel steel. There is steel holding this phone together. It has a rock-solid back to that completes the look and the bezel around this glass display. It'S very hard in glass and it's pretty sharp around the edges, but it is edge to edge glass. So you won't see it as a scene when you're holding the phone. Also, if you take a look at the entire design, it's not completely flat on the top on the bottom. It has a little bit of a curve to the design and has a pretty traditional button layout, which will remind you that it is definitely still competing with other high-end smartphones, like a Sony, Xperia Z, another 1080p phones coming out in the near future. So up on the front, you have the Menu button, the home button and the back button, and there is no multitasking button, obviously, but we'll get to that whole process in a second, but also just first off so we're clear. The headphone jack is up top, not my favorite location, but it's there and the audio sounds good and we have the power button on the left side, the USB port and the microphone on the bottom and the volume rocker. On the right side. Now I've been using Motorola and HTC and Samsung devices for so long that this power button volume, Rock replacement, felt backwards at first, but actually got used to it in a few days, and everything about this design is great and again it just screams quality everything about It even the packaging is awesome. Some US manufacturers could really learn from this very simple, clean, stylish and compact packaging and magnetic so it's really simple even has a subtle design on the top cover that I actually didn't notice until I revisited the box a few days later. So this is an awesome box. Even the Apple logo, SIM card ejector tool feels high-quality, got ta love this stuff back to the phone anyway, on the back is a pretty decent quality speaker. It actually gets really loud louder than most other smart phones, but it gets distorted when you crank it that loud, but it's pretty good overall and up top is a 13 megapixel camera and dual LED flash and microphone. Now this camera was hit or miss. Really it looks great on the spec sheet right, you know 13 megapixels, but it really just performs, like any other average 8 megapixel smartphone camera like something like the Optimus G really sort of middle-of-the-road, though I'm sure this can and will improve with ah pose constant firmware. Updates, as they seem really dedicated to updating it, but it takes ok photos. It takes HDR macro the whole nine, but I was really more impressed with the video mode it actually. Let me take 1080p. Hd are videos which gave me much more dynamic range in shots that were really bright and really dark. So it seems to do a pretty good job with that, especially for a smartphone, and I was actually most impressed with the 1.99 pickle meta, megapixel front-facing camera. It looked really good during video calls Google Hangouts, so I appreciate the good shooter on the front, but honestly overall. Clearly the fine 5 is a unique device that stands out from the pack, especially in the design and the build quality department. So if you want a phone, that's built like a tank. This is your phone, no doubt and when you turn it on hold the crap, this is very different. This is a pose skinned version of Android 4.1 jelly bean. Now the immediate first reaction is wow. That looks like a larger and more colorful stormtrooper iPhone now well, you'd be right, I can kind of admit it does look that way at first. This is a me UE looking skin, but then again this is Android, so you don't have to like everything about these home screens. Out of the you can just throw a Nova Launcher at an icon pack at whatever widgets you want, and you will never have to see this look again. You don't even have to be rooted. So that's the beauty that runs Android is very flexible, but out of the box, this is what it looks like and it's honestly a pretty solid experience. You can't really knock it till you try it and again you do get widgets and all these things. So it's not all just square icons, they've taken some hints from the US manufacturers like Samsung, who don't just put a skin on it to make it look different, but they actually add value. They add features to make the smartphone look better or make it more useful. So the notification bar is a perfect example. The Oppo took the opportunity to add some custom, toggles and information to the notification bar. Another example is a multitasking which allows you to see not one, not two but three of your most recent apps and you can swipe them away and swipe between them to close them, and you also get an idea of how much of your two gigabytes of RAM Is free, so they've done a pretty good job with this kind of stuff, there's also a bunch of stock apps that all have a similar design language among them. So it's kind of unifying the feel among the apps that come pre-installed on this phone. The only problem with that is that these are all third-party and when you start to add other third-party apps from the Play Store at least the good ones. Anyway, they all follow Google's new holo design for Android 4.2, so they're, all blue and dark themed, and these apps might look a little funky on the Oppo find 5. They might not even fit in really, but even though they don't work or they do work perfectly and they fit the platform beautifully. That might look a little out of place. Web pages look pretty awesome. They are great on the 1080p display and they load pretty quickly and scrolling and zooming around it can all be handled by that Snapdragon s4. Pro and Google Chrome is the stock browser. So it's a pretty natural experience, so it's a good job there and it comes pre-installed with this suite file manager. It'S actually good looking, so I'm going to go ahead and use it to show you the benchmarks that I got on that Snapdragon s4 pro so yeah in case you were worried about this skin slowing down performance, nope been synthetic benchmarks, gave it pretty high marks. So you won't have to worry about getting sluggish or choppy performance or anything like that. This thing flies, but yeah. The distinguishing thing about the software is that all of the pre-installed bundled apps have that same white light, and they all look good and beautiful. On that 1080p display and everything, but they might not match your dark hollow Play, Store apps they even though they're really high quality. All the extra bundled features and the UI tweaks aren't changed just for the sake of changing them, but they're changed with the intent of making it better and making their own software design work on this device. So it's a very Oppo device, as you can see. Overall, I think it flows pretty well. The UI is overall pretty smooth and I rarely got stuck trying to figure anything out coming from another Android device. Also, a question people want to ask is how well does it keep up with a power user? You know someone like me who uses their phone every day with hours of screen on time, and I got to say it kept up pretty well with me: I'm a consistent user and it was really snappy the whole day, maybe not Nexus 4 snappy, but it was Acceptable fast and the battery often lasts me when I get up at 5:30 in the morning, don't ask until around 11:00 or 12:00 at night, which qualifies as a full day in my book and speaking of screen on time. That 1080p display is, of course, magnificent for gaming for using that Snapdragon s4 pro for watching YouTube videos, even it's beautiful. Just like the Droid DNA, it's a big bright and nice looking display viewing angles are also top-notch like you would expect, and it of course blows. The AMOLED displays out of the water in terms of brightness, so the fine 5 handles its business man, it's a unique phone, no doubt, but it's unique in the way that makes you want to pick it up and try it rather than ignore it and wait for Something else and that's something: a boss phone does best build quality out there and one of the nicest cleanest designs rivals the buttonless Galaxy Nexus in terms of sexiness my opinion and I'm convinced that after all this time the weight was definitely worth it alright. So there you go guys, that is it, that is the Oppo find 5. It'S the Stormtrooper of all smartphones in terms of design, and it is a boss in terms of build quality. So clearly is on top of at least my list right now for 2013, it's gon na be hard to beat this in my opinion, and definitely in terms of build, I feel like I get a hammer and nail into wood with this thing and I'd be more Worried about breaking the nail, then I would be about breaking the phone now. I knows how to get a good sense of how well you would actually like the phone in person, but it definitely feels like a slightly more Ridge. Lumia. 920. It'S a little bit lighter a little bit thinner a little bit sharper a little bit more handsome and, to be honest on paper. This thing is a beast on the spec sheet: it has a 5-inch 1080p display. It has a quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro really good. Processor. Probably the best on the line still right now: Android 4.1 jelly bean, 2,500 million power battery 16 gigs of storage, 2 gigabytes of RAM. It'S it's clearly a a world-class smartphone, and this is aa pose way of saying: hey. We can make world-class smartphones too, and they've. Definitely proven that so my root, my result is, I guess, check it out. Consider it it's one of the best and it will be for a while. Thanks for watching, there's been an mkbhd review video and if you like, what you saw I'll be sure to give it a thumbs up. That really does help out, and if you want to see more videos like this be sure to subscribe. That button is also below. Thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys. The next one peace you """
8gca3uud87c,Samsung Galaxy Camera Review!,5:17,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kay PhD here, and this is the Samsung Galaxy camera. So the easiest way to describe this product is to take a samsung galaxy s3 phone take out the ability to make phone calls which basically gives you a mini tablet. Then slap on a 16 megapixel camera and lens and a flash and that's how Samsung Galaxy cameras are made now, but seriously. This guy has gotten quite a bit of attention during the holiday season and I did do an initial hands-on with this guy. A few weeks ago, but my overall thoughts are still very mixed and here's why? First off with the pros it's a pretty decent, build quality, no doubt about that. It feels durable, no creaking or anything like that. It'S also relatively small, I'm not going to say it's! The smallest digital camera out there, but it definitely counts as a portable camera. I suppose you could install Skype on it and, if you really wanted to you can make calls on it, but I don't think most people are going to want to hold this thing up to their ear. It'S a bit chunky, not exactly small enough to be pocketable anyway, so this begins to separate itself from other digital cameras thanks to its connectivity. This is probably the most connected camera out there right now. It'S essentially a mini tablet on the back, so you can open up the bottom and throw in a SIM card and connect to Wi-Fi and 4G. If you want so, you can install any app from the Google Play Store. This is a really well connected camera. It'S running Android 4.1 jelly bean, so project butter is there and it's just as responsive and fast as you'd expect it to be just like a galaxy s3. The user interface is also the next place. It differentiates itself. It takes advantage of that four point. Eight inch Super AMOLED touchscreen on the back very different from most other cameras, and that provides a lot of room for control. So it gives you just about the same level of control as a regular digital camera. So it can take, you know full automatic or you can use one of the many smart modes which acts like a preset setting for certain shooting scenarios and most of them work pretty well, if you pick correctly and if you're really feeling daring, this camera has some Full manual modes as well, it has an aperture priority mode, brightness changing mode, a full manual or shutter priority, and whichever setting you're in you can use the sliders to basically adjust the camera setting. And you can view the preview behind all those sliders in real time. So in full manual you can move all these sliders and when you feel like you have that shot dialed in you can just tap out and take your picture as a side note. The only issue I had with the speed of the camera was moving from a photo-taking mode to a photo viewing mode. Sometimes it seemed like it took an extra second to actually do what you asked it to do. Once you push the button on the screen. Obviously, things can't be instantaneous, but that's just something I noticed while I started using it, I'm sure this can be fixed also with a software update from Samsung, but the biggest drawback of this camera is, while the camera itself. I gave it to my not so tech-savvy sister to take pictures during the recent holiday. So, of course, it was in full, auto indoors and a lot of the shots taken turned out pretty well, but the ISO is really only acceptable up to about 1600 from the sensor that you can go up to 6400 if you're, ok with the visible noise in The image, even though on auto there is no flash. You can hit the manual flash pop-up button, but beginners won't know this. So the shutter speed went all the way down to 1/8 and 1/4 of a second, so motional motion blur ends up being a problem with some photos indoors. The video quality was also hit or miss. It really depends on the light available. Just like a smartphone. There can be a few pros, though autofocus was pretty quick during video and for photos as well, so the shots were able to be taken pretty quickly and the 21 X optical zoom is nice. That can be tremendously useful, especially outdoors. What'S awkward, though, as a camera is that it takes some microSD cards instead of regular SD cards like a phone so but then again it does have 8 gigabytes of internal storage. So it's whatever you want, you might not need any cards at all thing is. This. Is supposed to be a camera first, but ironically, that's where most of its shortcomings are. In fact, the Galaxy Note 2 went shot for shot for shot for shot with this camera until we broke out that 21 X optical zoom, while our phones have to rely on digital zoom, but I mean let's face it. No other compact camera has a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core processor, no other camera. Has this huge 4.8 inch HD LED touchscreen display on the back? No other camera runs Android 4.1 jelly bean and has full access to the Play Store with Instagram and all of its apps and games. Hardly any other cameras out. There are even Wi-Fi, capable they're, barely Wi-Fi capable and this one is 4G capable and can share photos, literally as they are taken to services like Instagram and Dropbox in Gmail and Google Plus that's what makes this a different product, but for the price. This F two point: eight to five point: nine lens and a slightly small 16 megapixel sensor and the image and video quality, basically that this produces doesn't really match up, and I think that's where Samsung kind of swung and missed with this product. That being said, I have faith in Samsung to get it right on the next release and I am absolutely looking forward to the Samsung Galaxy camera 2 and that's the one I would recommend waiting for """
IysmRC4aAFc,Google Nexus 10 Review!,7:04,"Hey, what's up guys mkbhd here with Google's Nexus 10, it's a flagship, super high-resolution, Android tablet. Of course, it's made by Samsung and sold by Google and this review video I'll. Try to give you a couple of things that you might want to know about this tablet. If you're considering buying it and basically what differentiates it from other tablets that I've already reviewed, the first differentiation is on the outside the design and the build - and this is an interesting combination of specs on this tablet on the outside. You have a hardened plastic, build that feels pretty good in the hand, it's pretty lightweight about 600 grams and it feels great, especially because of the awesome tacky material on the back. It really surprised me in the unboxing that I did and I definitely still love it. Even though it is a super fingerprint magnet, I still love it. It'S a super simple design really with the pogo pins down at the bottom, the volume and power buttons up top and the overall slightly curved design in order to fit well in two hands and landscape mode, and has these awesome front-facing triple-channel speakers? These are great for media consumption which we'll get to in a second, and you can't even really cover them all with your hands, because there's such large speakers something also that's weird about the volume buttons is when you go from landscape to portrait mode, the volume buttons Are backwards so the top brings volume down and the bottom brings volume up. So that's something you'll have to get used to a little quirky at the top of the back. Here is a removable panel with magnets, underneath for a future Smart Cover like accessory that, hopefully, Google will start selling in the Play Store very soon, there's also a 5 megapixel camera and flash in the middle, which actually takes some pretty decent shots. But then again, why would you take pictures with the tablet anyway below that is a 9000 milliamp hour battery which easily lasted me days on end with medium use? It did take a little extra time to charge because it's such a big battery, but it was worth it and you got about 5 hours of screen on time. The next thing you should know about this tablet is the internals. This guy is rocking an Exynos 5 dual core CPU with the Mallee T, 604 GPU 2 gigabytes of RAM and up to 32 gigabytes of sealed storage bench marks indicate that this is a mid-range device with solid power. Basically, but these benchmarks don't exactly translate well into real life performance speaking of performance, this thing flies, and that's because of the next thing that differentiates this tablet from others is that it is indeed a nexus. It'S running stock, pure Android, 4.2 jelly bean. So the tablet layout for Android has changed so now you get those same back home and multitasking software buttons down at the bottom that you get on phones. I don't know if I like this more or less than the older honeycomb layout, but I can see why they changed it. Another change is the split pulldown trays, so the one on the left is for your regular notifications and the one on the right. Is your quick settings, so you get all sorts of settings controls and this works particularly well for me on a tablet, because I am constantly adjusting things like screen: brightness, toggling, Wi-Fi on and off turning autorotation on and off and more. But you can even toggle multiple user accounts from here, so it's all just a swipe down away, and it's pretty useful to me also as usual I'll reference you guys to my video linked down below in the description below the like button on this video, in which I cover everything that is new in Android 4.2 jelly bean. The next unique thing you need to know about this tablet is easily the most important. It is that this is a 2560 by 1600 IPS display my gosh. This thing handles the best-looking mobile display out there. Now it takes a couple of things to make such a display a good experience. Not only does it have to be a good quality display, but you need the content to take advantage of it. You need the apps games, movies, videos, software, fonts icons, you need so many things to be optimized for such a high res display content, optimization, that's what we'll call it and content optimization is what's missing on this tableau right now. First of all, there aren't a whole lot of apps that are optimized for Android tablets to begin with. So when you open them, they have the telltale signs of a phone icon and they run the phone app in landscape mode, and on top of that there are very few apps that are optimized to take full advantage of this high density 300 PPI display. So there will be apps that work perfectly on this tablet layout, but you'll be able to see where certain developers use lower resolution icons or didn't update their graphics fully, so you'll be able to see pixelization in some apps. That being said, the apps and games that do work and are optimized for tablets and are optimized for this display look phenomenal, especially with text you'll, see text in something like Google Books or Google Play magazines. They are the most impressive parts of when you're. Looking at things are optimized for this display also high resolution images really stand out and pop. This isn't an AMOLED display, so the contrast ratios aren't quite as high as some of the other tablets, like the Galaxy Note 10.1, but I'd honestly rather have this IPS display for immediate consumption than any other that exists right now. Android itself is optimized. Google apps are optimized, the keyboard is optimized and you'll notice that super crisp text pretty much everywhere through Android menus and graphics. All of them are high-quality, so that's the first thing as optimized, and but just you and you're buying a new tablet like this you're. Pretty much waiting on in the ecosystem to catch up to it, Gaming can be a phenomenal experience, but you'll be waiting on games to play that actually look phenomenal because they were all built. You know originally for 1280 by 720 displays the games. I found that are fully optimized for the Nexus 10 seriously. Having me holding on to this tablet and keeping it for the future of what this experience will be like and Google is doing, their fair share and encouraging developers and people like that to update their apps. Their icons, their graphics, etc. To look great on a display like this. That being said right now, it's really hit or miss simply because this display is so far ahead of its time either way. The Nexus 10 is in stock right now, as as soon as I'm doing this narration right now, it is in stock in a Play Store, so don't even waste. Your time check it out. The link is below this. Video for G Nexus, 10 might be the dream, but there is only a Wi-Fi only model this guy for now to wrap it all up. This is an excellent tablet for an excellent price just enough ahead of its time, for it to become its biggest weakness. For now, if you guys have any questions or anything you want to know about, this, guy feel free to leave that in the comments section below where you can see me answering them, and if you want to see more videos like this go ahead and subscribe, that's It that's the Nexus 10. Thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the very next video face you """
zFOnOLXrMBQ,Google Nexus 4 Review!,9:36,"Hey what's up guys mkbhd here, and this is the google nexus 4 and it's finally here shipping out in waves from the Google Play Store as the successor to the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, so Google partnered with LG to make this device and on the outside it's pretty Easy to see how the LG Nexus 4 came to be the next Nexus. It looks pretty similar on the front to the last one. Both have similar curvatures, similar sensor placement up top and no ugly branding or any logos elsewhere on the phone both have little Chin's and they both seem to embody the Nexus feel. In fact, the Nexus 4 is an almost perfect hybrid, falling right in between the LG Optimus G and the Galaxy Nexus and a lot of ways. First of all, the Optimus G on the left is that square shape. The Galaxy Nexus on the right is very curvy, so the Nexus 4 here in the middle is a nice hybrid. Between those two looks. The Nexus 4 also takes a glass of the front and back of the optimus G, along with the sealed in battery the slot speaker and the 8 megapixel camera. It also takes its LTE chip, but we'll get to that in a second from the Galaxy Nexus. It takes at pure Android 4.2 experience the beautiful pulsating notification light we loved so much and that very clean Nexus. Look on the front, something it doesn't take from either. Phone, though, is that backing behind the glass? Is this textured almost glittery pattern that no other phone has and when it catches the light right, it looks awesome, it's very bright, very vivid, very, very different from other phones. You can't actually feel the texture when holding the phone, but underneath that glass there's some LG handiwork that makes it twinkle and catch a few eyes. So overall, on the hardware front, the Nexus 4 is definitely a good premium feeling phone its Gorilla Glass 2. On the front and on the back, but it has this nice soft touch material on the beveled sides, which makes it really nice to hold. I think Google spent a lot of time making this phone of pleasing one-handed experience and I think they did a good job and it's a little tiny bit heavier than the Galaxy s3, but it's definitely a light phone very much lighter than most other phones out there. Oh and don't drop this phone, it does have Gorilla Glass 2 on the back and everything, but if it hits the right angle, it we'll crack anyway and Google does sell a bumper and the Google Play Store for those of you who may drop your phones a Lot but phones aren't meant to be dropped, so don't drop this guy now. The Nexus 4 is an awesome upgrade from the unlocked Galaxy Nexus. The price is super low and you can just pop your SIM card out of one and into the other. Literally, everything about the phone is an upgrade so from the Snapdragon s4 pro quad-core processor, which is a boss to the two gigabytes of ram to the new 8 megapixel camera. Everything is an upgrade if you're on the Verizon Galaxy Nexus, though it's a tough choice to end your contract and move to a new plan, but I can still recommend it for the true nexus experience you can see, comparing the displays that there is also a huge Improvement here, the Nexus 4 has a 1280 by 768 IPS display and it gets way brighter and it's super easy to read in broad daylight, unlike the dimmer AMOLED displays on things like the Galaxy Nexus, and this display makes watching movies and even HD YouTube videos. A great experience, but the speaker kind of hinders that a bit it's loud, but it's super tinny and you can accidentally cover the whole thing with your finger and then you just can't hear it at all. But the screen makes a video watching experience a definite plus. It'S not like a terrible speaker or anything, but it's something you should note, and the new 8 megapixel camera on the Nexus. 4 is quite good. It actually surprised me I'd, say it's about on par with the galaxy s3 and the Galaxy Note 2 and the shots you can get out of it, especially with HDR mode on it can look like they came out of something other than a cell phone camera. So that's great and 1080p video out of this guy looks nice too, and you can take pictures while you are recording video just by tapping the screen, while the video is recording now to focus on the Snapdragon s4 pro for a second. This is a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core processor running Android 4.2 jelly bean with project butter. So by that logic, everything should be buttery, smooth and snappy, and almost everything is, but there are still a few problems with chrome, sometimes and the occasional dropped frame in certain pinch-to-zoom animations. But real world performance is still noticeably snappier than any other Android phone I've ever used. This is a ridiculously device, and what's interesting is that there are still some apps that are clearly not optimized for Android, 4.2 and you'll be able to tell when you're looking at them, so that'll be up to developers to fix, and that's what leads me to believe That benchmark scores were unusually low. I mean I got fifty three hundred or so on quadrant, while the Optimus G with the same processor and RAM broke seven thousand so yeah optimization is an ongoing process, but definitely real-world performance opening apps flying through multitasking. All the typical things that you do every day on your phone when you're, you're navigating places and you have multiple applications open at once - that's all going to be very very fast Gaming is also excellent. I can promise that the Nexus 4 handles games like a boss. I'M not a huge gamer, but I've played Need for Speed on so many other platforms that I had to get it here and it is super fun frame rates are high. Everything looks great on this display and it's all just super responsive. I haven't found any games that look bad yet on the Nexus 4. It does, however, heat up a little bit on the back sometimes, and you can replicate this by playing a game or two for yourself and in just a few minutes. It'Ll, be warm, not a big deal to most people, but it's weird to actually feel the processor working hard anyway. Of course, the biggest reason people buy. This phone is for pure Android, 4.2 jelly bean and all its awesome features and fast updates straight from Google. As the stock Android experience is a buying point by itself so lucky for you, I have an entire separate video linked in the description down below the like button on this video detailing the new features in Android 4.2, and they are all present on this phone. Now you would think that with no LTE and a sealed in 2100 milliamp hour battery that the Nexus 4 would last forever on a battery. But to be honest, it has just average battery life, nothing spectacular! It gets you through the day. Don'T get me wrong, but this is not a phone. That'S gon na get you crazy. You know four hours of screen on time or anything also there was an issue reported with some Nexus. 4 is having staticky earpieces during calls, but I never had that problem with mine. So that's a good sign and also LTE yeah. It'S it's based on the LTE optimus G I'll, give you that so it still has the LTE chip inside, but there's no amplifier and it early supports one band and you have to do some interesting little hackery to get it unlocked. So it's not exactly true. Lte support natively, but it's a great coincidence for some lucky Canadians, though, because their carriers do work with this one band, and there are a few simple steps to unlock this LTE. Also, apparently, t-mobile's LTE will use this band so we'll see how far the hackers and modders will take that so overall, what would make someone want to buy this Nexus? 4. Well number one! If you want stock Android right out the box and the fastest updates straight from Google and support for Android 4.2 jelly bean right out the box, then this is your phone right here, no question: if you want a very inexpensive high bang for your buck, unlocked phone, Then this is also a great choice. If you won't settle for anything less than that Snapdragon s4 pro chip, then this is definitely a great choice. I wouldn't buy this phone specifically for the camera or for the battery life, but they're certainly acceptable as far as high-end smartphones go, I would even go to say - and this is one of the best value - smart phones out there right now and it's certainly the best Nexus to date it seems to almost completely naturally separate itself from the rest literally, so there you go guys, that's the LG Nexus 4, like I've, said it's definitely one of the higher-end smartphones out there and it competes with the highest end on the market. Right now. Even at its lower price point in the Google Play Store and at the link down below the like button on this video now there are a couple of things you do need to know before buying something like the Nexus 4. While it is definitely a worthy upgrade from the GSM Galaxy Nexus, you are going to lose a few things because of the lower budget. Specifically, like we addressed the lack of LTE, so you won't be able to get this on Verizon and, yes, you can technically get LTE on it on one band on a couple of Canadian carriers and potentially t-mobile in the future. But that's not a buying point for this phone right now, even if you do get it on t-mobile, it's just a bonus if it happens to work later. But honestly, this is a really great phone and I would have no problem recommending it to anyone on AT """
yRaIjn6q9Jo,LG Optimus G Review! (Nexus 4 Comparison),4:07,"Hey what's up guys mkbhd here tomorrow is Nexus 4 day for me and, while I'll be covering the Nexus 4 in full detail. As soon as I get it, the lg optimus G here has been available for a little bit now, and this Optimus G is the older brother of the Nexus 4 and it's the phone that the Nexus 4 was based on. So before the wealth of Nexus 4 coverage coming your way shortly, here's a quick video for those of you who may be locked into an 18 t contract or are considering the optimus G. This is everything you need to know about it, that's different from the Nexus. 4, first of all, the hardware differences - and there are only a few of these - both of these - have the Snapdragon s4 pro chip inside two gigabytes of RAM, a 1280 by 768, beautiful IPS display with some pretty insane viewing angles and great outdoor visibility, and they all Have a relatively square design, with Gorilla Glass on both sides, but on the front the optimus G has an LG logo and at the bottom these capacitive touch buttons that do actually blend in nicely with the front bezel when they're off the Nexus 4 doesn't have these. It uses on-screen buttons and around the back. The optimus G has a sweet textured. Looking pattern surrounding its AT """
VdsMwGWvhO4,Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Review!,10:34,"Hey what's up guys mkbhd, and this is the Samsung Galaxy Note. 2 now Samsung has learned a lot from the success of the galaxy s3 people love that phone, so they started to take some design ideas from it and bring it to other products. So they shrunk. One down and made a Galaxy s3 mini and they stretched one out, and here we have the Galaxy Note 2. But this Note 2 is a little bit better than just a supercharged Galaxy s3. So we'll take a look and see all the reasons why that is now, but first of all the size, let's make a scale. This is the Galaxy Nexus, a phone that people originally thought was really big. Just borderline too big four point: six five inch display. Then another giant came along in a similar footprint that four point eight inch Galaxy s3. Both of these phones were and still are considered huge phones and then there's the Galaxy. Note a 5.5 inch behemoth of a display easily the largest of the smart phones out there right now, and you can see if the body of the galaxy s3 can almost fit in the screen of the note itself. It'S that spacious, a lot of people, seem to think it's too close to a tablet size, but trust me. It comes nowhere near the smallest of the Android tablets out there and what's neat is all these displays are the same 1280 by 720 resolution and because of the same resolution you don't actually see more content when you're, for example, looking at a webpage. But you do see the same content bigger on the note which helps with reading so some content. You just can't read it's too small when you're zoomed all the way out on the galaxy s3. But you look at it on the note and you can actually pretty much read it. No problem, oh and the note display also is not pentile, so that's also a plus, but you can't really talk much about this hardware without comparing it to that galaxy. S3. So I'll link my full galaxy s3 review down below the like button on this video, so you can get a better look at that, but in terms of comparison, these guys are rocking very similar exteriors. So the note 2 has the camera on the flash, both in the same spot up at the top of the phone, but it moves the speaker down to the bottom and they have a very similar slicked-back design. We, of course, both have the white versions here and they look look very similar. You can see that the design elements from the galaxy s3 have moved up to the galaxy notes size. They are also rocking the exact same imaging hardware, so the photo and video quality 1080p video is exactly the same. Both look very, very good. Obviously the biggest difference between the galaxy s3 and the note 2 is that screen size and you can call me freak or whatever, but I can touch all four corners of the galaxy s3 is four point. Eight inch display no problem at all, making it a one-handed device. You can type everything you can use the whole thing one-handed. The note 2, on the other hand, is a guaranteed 2 handed device for everyone, except maybe I don't know yeah Ming. You can't touch all four corners with one hand, but it makes for very easy two handed operation, especially when typing on that Samsung keyboard. There are some settings just on the note 2 from Samsung to make it easier for one-handed use to turn on and basically use the phone with one hand which basically just shrinks things down and moves them a little bit to one side of the screen. So with the calculator here, for example, you can use it with your left hand on the left hand, side if you're a lefty or, on the right hand, side with your right hand, if you're a righty and that's nifty. Now the one thing about the hardware is - and I don't know if it's just me or if it's just a my note, but the note 2 rocks when you press the right hand side of it, it rocks back and forth. That'S where the stylus sits. So I don't know if you know maybe the stylus is lighter than the rest of the body or if it's actually lopsided, but it's really annoying when I'm trying to type on a flat surface. And it keeps bouncing over to the right very nice. But I felt the need to mention that, but anyway, not only am i a fan of the note 2's quad-core processor and 2 gigs of ram and LTE, but software is pretty great too. It runs Android 4.1.1, jelly bean, which is the latest version out right now, and on top of that is a little bit of TouchWiz now you guys know that I prefer stock Android of the Nexus line any day of the week, but with the screen size like This you kind of do need some adjustments to be made, and you know you get some different looks some pre-installed apps and you know the messy ugly calendar app and the dreaded s voice is still present, but you also get things like Google now and Android 4.1. Jelly beans mandible notifications, which I love so much and you get a little nifty, slide to open apps from the lockscreen shortcuts and you can pick which apps go there. So even this wicked multitasking mode that lets you use two apps at once with half the screen for each app all this stuff, you get is a lot better than the previous versions, and this is way more responsive by the way than the first time they tried. This they tried this on a 10.1 inch tablet. It was awful, so I guess that shows off the note twos power - it's not even like. I use this feature a lot, but when I do holy hell, it is useful. I mean you can watch a video and fact check at the same time or you could use Facebook and Google Plus at the same time, whatever you want to do, it is fast and yes, that is because this Note 2 is a powerhouse. I never really put a lot of weight on benchmarks. You guys know that, and I might do a video about why in the near future. But I ran a quick quadrant standard benchmark to see how it compares to other Android devices to see if that quad-core and two gigs of ram held up and, of course that combo did turn out on top. But in the end, it's really more about the experience that these high-performance internals can deliver and boy do they deliver. Real-World performance here is a 10 out of 10. This is half the hardware and half jelly bean and project butter at work here, but everything everything is buttery smooth and I love it. Gaming on this huge display is really fun, whatever game you're playing, whether you're, slicing and dicing fruit in landscape mode like a boss or outrunning some zombies in portrait mode. Everything happens so smooth on this massive display that it's really refreshing and pleasing to see for someone who's been using Android Sense, Eclair like me, and even if you're, not gaming, regular performance in apps that you use everyday is stellar. It'S almost like you, don't even notice that there could ever be any hang-ups, they just don't happen and I never ever ever ever thought. I would say this ever, but I kind of like the stylus and and don't worry you don't have to like it too. You don't you, don't even have to use a stylus, it's just in addition to the phone, but to me it feels like a part of the experience of using this phone, especially a phone. This you about the stylus and it's like. Oh, you want to use a stylus. You know here's a few things that you might like to do using it for everyday use. You might have previously used your fingers kind. It feels kind of weird to use it in place of your finger. So I'll put it that way, I mean it responds really well, just like your fingers do and it's not 2001, where the stylus is like. You know a necessity to your phone and response times were more like project chunky, peanut butter than project butter, but it's an accessory. You know it's called the Galaxy Note and it is a major marketing feature for Samsung that you can use this stylus, but I just kind of use it once in a while. You know, and I have fun when I do, and also PS the handwriting recognition that it's straight up, one of the most impressive things I've ever seen on a phone next to Google. Now it is scarily accurate, no matter how messy your righty or Lefty handwriting may be. It'S really really good, so that handwriting recognition is a plus in the stylus by itself. There'S also even this hover feature, which is pretty neat, so you can hover over things without actually clicking them. That can reveal what certain buttons do or you can have it slide through previews of a video clip to get to a clip. You want to watch or even content awareness. So it knows when it's hovering over a text box and when it's not so all the stuff, bundles together in a stylus that fits neatly in the side of the note out of the way, if you don't want it and it's called the s-pen and right next To that S, Pen in the body is the second largest battery in any phone coming in at 3100 milliamp hours and I actually tried to kill it. I tried for a full day, unsuccessfully constant use six and a half hours of screen on time, 22 hours of being on. I tried so hard, but it still wasn't dead. 10 % left at 11:25 p.m. so I called it quits very, very impressive, long long battery life on this guy. So a couple that battery life with super phone specs a massive non pentile 5.5 inch 720p Super AMOLED display buttery, smooth performance with Android 4.1 and a bulging or pocket like no other. You can be proud to rock the Galaxy Note 2, which is arguably the best phone you can get right now, so there you go guys. That'S been my experience with the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Overall, this is absolutely a flagship of a phone. There'S no question about that: it has a quad core processor, Android, 4.1 jelly bean LTE in the United States, a huge 3300 milliamp hour battery that could last two days with no problems. The only thing about it is the really large size, and that would make someone either consider it or throw it down the drain. But I think that you can try it out and you can actually get a better a sense of how big it feels in person and you'll get used to it. I didn't think I was going to get used to it at all. I thought it would always seem big to me, but now this seems phone size to me, which is a little weird to say, but it makes the galaxy s3 seem small, which makes the Galaxy Nexus seem really small, which makes other smaller phones seem mini as Samsung Would definitely agree so the choice is yours: go ahead, leave a thumbs up on this video. If you want to see a more in-depth comparison to its brother over here, the galaxy s3. I know a lot of people were interested in both the similarities and the differences. So I covered a little bit of that, but if you want to see a full video, let me know if there's a comments section. If you want to talk about this and either way, that's been it thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the very next video which should be one that you'll be really excited to see.

Teyx-jx2Ano,Asus Zenbook Prime Review!,4:17,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kay PhD here, so an honor of recent events that have the word HD in them. We'Re gon na be taking a look at the asus zenbook prime, with the HD display. As you don't already know, the Motorola RAZR HD was announced two days ago and the Amazon Kindle Fire HD was announced yesterday. So today we're gon na be taking a look at the Ultrabook with the HD screen. The 1080p 13 inch mat a laptop, let's go ahead and take a look so think of this UX 32 as an upgraded version of the UX 31, the x31 of last year. If you haven't already watched it, I review the UX 31. It'S the first link in the description below the like button on this video and it's one of my favorite ultra books out there, so this UX 32 is an upgrade. So it has some neat new features. First off inside is an upgraded 1.9 gigahertz intel core i7 Ivybridge processor and dedicated graphics card. An Nvidia GT, 620 M and I graphics card - has one gig of video memory and there is 8 gigs of upgradable RAM on board and an SSD for the operating system and a 500 gig upgradable, 7 millimeter harddrive for storage. This thing has beastly laptop specs with most ultrabooks the RAM and the storage are soldered to the motherboard, so they're not upgradable, but they are here - and this is all wrapped in a nice thin very transportable - 3.2 pound magnesium alloy body. So it's boat like a boss. Just like the original it even has these new ports, so you'll find a USB 3.0 port, a full-size media card reader on the other side, more USB 3.0 ports, a full size, HDMI port and more - and these neat slots on the sides are actually high quality speakers. They'Re, not events they're, really nice speakers, so the only venting going on is happening at the bottom back of this laptop, but I'm gon na be totally honest guys. There is only one real reason: you buy this over the UX 31: it's not the massive specs. It'S not the 6 hour battery life, it's not even the backlit keyboard, which is cool, but it's the display. This 13-inch Ultrabook is rocking a 1920 by 1080p IPS display with a matte finish. It'S awesome: it's freaking, beautiful, very color, accurate, very bright, and the trackpad is also nice and big. So there's plenty of room to move the mouse around. All these pixels has a nice high, pixel density and it responds well to some new guest errs thanks to some asus software. So that's a nice touch. Oh and it can do this check it out. Oh yeah, I don't think your laptop can do that, but seriously this guy turns heads. It has the same finish on the back as those high-end Asus Transformer Pad tablets very high quality. It'S an all-around great machine, basically they've updated everything inside the UX 31 and crammed it into this nice sized thin and light laptop in the UX 32, and it's not bad looking either. It'S a great performer thanks to that Ivy Bridge processor, the RAM, the graphics card and the SSD for cash. A lot of people wonder: can you game on it? Yes, you can. You can get away with some light to mid-range gaming, I wouldn't say crisis or anything, but it can handle Minecraft easily world of warcraft a little need for speed stuff, like that. I happen to use this guy for note-taking in school, so it goes everywhere with me. Fits in my backpack and I don't have to worry about it - bumping into things like textbooks with that magnesium case. So yeah, it's a boss. It earns buff status. Congratulations a Seuss! Well done! So there you go guys! This is a laptop. I can pretty much recommend for anyone. It is thin, which makes it really light and really really good for school. I happen to use this a lot for a note-taking and a lot for college or, if you guys, are starting University. It'S a good thing to check out so check out ultra books and check out the UX 32. The link to check it out is down in the description below either way, thanks for watching this review video, this quick overview hope you enjoy it and give it a thumbs up. If you did and I'll talk to you guys in the very next video doc, you guys is you """
YddnWW_JYiY,Google Nexus 7 Review!,7:06,"Up until now, there was never a Nexus tablet. There were Nexus phones, but no tablet. The Motorola Xoom, for example, was a 10 inch tablet running stock Android, but it's not a nexus and the Asus Transformer has run a very close version of stock Android, but not exactly and they're, not nexuses. So when Google announced a tablet, they made a few very curious decisions behind the scenes and came up with this: the Nexus 7, the a gigabyte Nexus 7 costs $ 200. You know what else costs $ 200. The 8 gigabyte iPod touch. Ok, so that gives you a good idea of the bang for buck that you get out of the sky and that bang comes from a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core Tegra 3 chip and 1 gigabyte of RAM all behind the scenes powering Android 4.1 jelly bean. Now, I'm not going to restate all of the reasons why Android 4.1 is so awesome, but there's an annotation and a link below to my video covering all of the best new features of the operating system, but most notably during my time with the device project butter. As I spend more time with it, I've actually noticed it's more Universal around the entire operating system than I first thought it was. People always demonstrate it just by swiping around the launcher. You know between home screens and through the app tray, but it's even inside of apps too so scrolling through websites and chrome turning pages and books and navigating through apps. The overall touch response everywhere just makes it seem super fast and that's going to keep the tablet feeling newer longer and I'm not even much of a gamer, but even the games I played seem to perform better and at higher frame rates thanks to butter. Now the apps, the apps, are very important when talking about the Nexus 7, a lot of people will criticize it saying. Android still lacks tablet apps, which can be true, but thanks to the smaller 7-inch display and the resolution it handles phone optimized apps, just as well as it handles tablet. Optimized apps. So it's kind of like a hybrid between the two and lets to get a peek into the best of both worlds. Now not all apps are compatible with Android 4.1. Yet so, if your favorite third-party app isn't compatible, send an email to that developer and there are some pretty sweet new apps being updated to take advantage of the 7-inch screen. So that's pretty cool one thing: that's also different with the larger display, since the seven-inch tablet is notifications and Google's created an interesting spin-off of the regular Android phones, pulldown notifications, the pulldown tray here doesn't take up the whole screen. It'S just in the center when you're in portrait mode, and you get all that neat new stuff with expandable notifications that Google has baked into Android 4.1. Some very useful stuff in here neat features and third-party apps can also take advantage of these expandable notifications. But the neat thing is once you go into landscape, it shifts over to the left-hand side, so you can actually still kind of see what's going on in the background, which is nice and you'll notice, though, that the Nexus 7 does go back to feeling, like a Large phone, when it doesn't let you rotate the homescreen into landscape, so like some of the bigger tablets out there, they go straight to landscape, but the Nexus 7 doesn't let you rotate the home to landscape mode. Just yet. Overall, though, if you're concerned about the seven inch form factor not feeling large enough to be different from your phone trust me, it is, for example, after using the Galaxy s3 for about a month. The current iPhone seemed like this. I'M going from a 7-inch tablet back down to a four point: eight inch phone. It has a similar effect. I still use the Nexus 7 as a one-handed device, though, but that may just because I have huge hands, not really sure either way. I mentioned at the beginning of the video that it's a two hundred dollar tablet and we've seen some pretty crappy $ 200 tablets. In terms of build quality, but this one is fine trust me to keep it thin like this. It'S sealed into one rigid design, so you have to twist it really hard to get it to flex, and this also means no expandable storage or replaceable battery, but no worries about the battery. The 4325 milliamp hour battery lasts plenty long easily, a full two days of regular use. There'S no camera on the back of the Nexus 7. But let's face it, it's a tablet. You don't really need it, but there is a front facing camera and plenty of apps in the Play Store that can take advantage of it. The only gripe I have about the exterior was a placement of these buttons. Yes, it's a one-handed device, but that doesn't mean you have to put all the buttons on one side, I found myself blindly reaching to turn the volume up on a YouTube video and I press the power button right next to it, instead, which turn the screen off. So that's a little bit annoying, but I would have liked to see the power and volume buttons a little bit further apart, oh and that plastic back does help Wi-Fi reception. It'S almost always full strength, Baus and a small touch is the elongated speaker on the back, which makes it really difficult to block the whole thing accidentally and the display on the front while it isn't a Retina display or anything crazy like that, it's 200 bucks. It'S more than 200 pixels per inch at 1280 by 720, and it looks damn impressive anyway. Now it's Wi-Fi only and this one happens to be a gigabytes and that's a bad combo. If you're one of those people who's away from Wi-Fi all the time and wants to save stuff for offline use, which is why I'm thinking go with the 16 gigabyte or there maybe something along the lines of a nexus 10, perhaps with a cellular radio somewhere in The near future, so in the end, is the nexus 7, a good product. Is it worth the $ 200 for this a gig version here, Google spends about $ 200 to make it and then sells it for about $ 200, but they're trusting that you will spend enough time in the Google Play Store on this device to start giving. Google more money and make it worth itself, they even give you a $ 25 credit to the Google Play Store. So once you go through that Google Play credit, you run out of 25 bucks, maybe a couple hours after you get it or a couple of days or a couple of months, but once you finally run out of that free credit you're going to start spending money On apps books, movies, games, TV shows and all kinds of things like that and that'll, hopefully be giving Google a lot more money than when you originally purchase this tablet. That'S what they're banking on and that's why they made a nexus tablet for the Google Play Store. All the ads you see for the Nexus are talking about the fact that this is built for the Google Play Store and that's exactly why they even give you a free copy of, like I showed you, the Transformers Dark of the Moon movie, hoping that you'll enjoy The experience so much that you'll want to buy more movies in the Google Play Store and give Google more money. Overall, though, I was interested in what they were going to come up with for the first Nexus tablet, because there was no Nexus tablet before this. There was a Motorola Xoom, which also happens to be stock, but this is the first Nexus tablet and they decided to go with a 7 inch form factor and that sort of intrigued me, but I turned out to like it a lot. So what do you guys think if you enjoyed this video review, feel free to give it a thumbs up and leave your thoughts in the comment section below and you can see I'm probably already answer in the comments down there so open conversation to talk about the Nexus 7, either way, thanks for watching this video hope you enjoyed it and looking forward to the next one. Thank you for watching talk to you later. You """
ddI-ZZwFclc,Asus Transformer Pad Infinity Review!,5:18,"The Asus Transformer Pad Infinity is here, and it is better than ever think of this as the new and improved transformer prime now I did a review of the transformer prime already and you can check that out BAM right here for the annotation, but the Infinity has A faster 1.6 eager Hertz quad-core, Tegra 3 processor, 1 gigabyte of faster ddr3 RAM, a higher resolution, 2 megapixel front facing shooter and a 1920 by 1200 Full HD display now that bottom bar on Android is exactly 120 pixels tall. So you can watch 1080p movies and YouTube videos on this tablet in actual native 1080p and we'll talk more about the display in a second. But the hardware on this tablet is absolutely the best of any tablet I have ever held it's built like a boss. It'S the back of the transformer prime that is made entirely of metal up until the last inch or so up on the top, which switches over to this hardened plastic. What that actually does is it improves the GPS and Wi-Fi reception a lot over the all-metal transformer prime, which I even had some issues with and while still retaining a much more premium feel than the all plastic transformer pad. 300. The power and volume buttons are also repositioned and changed so they're up top and they have a deeper travel which is really nice. They feel better to press and about the only thing unchanged about the back. Is that 8 megapixel camera and the somewhat mediocre speaker? And it also sports, this neat very thin wedge shape, it's pretty much the exact thinness of the transformer prime that came before it and it even works with the transformer Prime's dock. If you already have that and of course, that dock, yes, the full keyboard dock, I reviewed in its own separate video down in the description below that like button. So you can check that out. If you want, it adds some extra hours of battery. Of course, the full-size SD card slot the full-size USB port and a whole bunch of other advantages, besides just being a sweet, attachable keyboard, it's what really makes it a transformer but on to the front of the tablet. This is a Gorilla Glass super IPS, 1920 by 1200, 224 pixel per inch 10 inch mobile display, I mean, did asus leave anything off that list. That is a pretty hot specs for a display right there, but it runs Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, and this is actually currently its biggest flaw. I can explain so right now: Android 4.0 and Tegra 3 are kind of like strangers. You put them in the same room to work together in the same device to work together and sometimes Android says here. Let me take over the performance. I got this. I know how much RAM there is. I got it and other times they take a three-chip says. Wait a second, let me look at what's going on. Let me control performance right now. I can handle it. The result is really a mixed bag of sometimes buttery, smooth performance and other times. Things like web browsing or sometimes light work or even scrolling, are much more choppy. As that Tegra 3 decides it doesn't need to ramp up all four cores and it just kind of relaxes a bit. So you know gaming and camera performance and high-end tasks are very fast they're top of the charts, because Android and Tegra 3 have both agreed and decided to push the performance to the max, because it's all about frame rates at that point and the experience is great. At the high end, but for lower end tasks, just like swiping between home screens may be searching for YouTube videos or browsing Lite websites. You might notice more frames, so you check out all that stuff. I'Ve explained it a bit more in my transformer prime full review, but basically Android 4.1 goes beyond fixing this and they introduced project butter which actually guarantees an extremely smooth across the UI performance. Pretty much everything you do in the EOS is around 60 frames per. Second, super super smooth performance and asus has announced that all of the asus transformers will be getting Android 4.1. Now, something to note is Android 4.1 already runs beautifully on another Asus. Tegra 3 tablet the Nexus 7, which is awesome news, because this is also an Asus Tegra 3 tablet, which means Android 4.1, will likely perform even more amazingly on this faster Tegra 3 inside the Transformer Pad Infinity. But, aside from all that, this tablet is really a great experience right out. The box, you sign in with your Google account you get all the Google stuff, it has an awesome battery life and it gets even more battery when you use that dock with it. As an incredibly impressive super IPS 2 play for that outdoor viewability, all kinds of high-end experiences going on with this device, especially when you consider this hardware right now. It'S a story of amazing hardware and decent software, but they both kind of have to complement each other. To complete the package, so I say that when this tablet gets Android 4.1.1 jelly bean, it is going to be the best Android tablet that money can buy hands down. You """

Just pumping super high quality audio into your brain, the cabinet on these is also really high quality and they are all magnetically shielded, so you can have it right next to your ultra sore, monitor if you wish, and even have your phone right next to it or On top of it - and it won't make a difference which is really typically what you would do with a monitor another plus one for these in the awesome Department is that these are internally amplified, which means you don't need another amplifier to plug these in. You can plug them in straight into your computer and both the one-inch tweeter and the 5 inch woofer in that cabinet back there they're amplified. So that means you're going to get nice loud, sound power bass, just accurate punchy, sounds without any sort of amplification. They see that slot at the bottom of the woofer. That'S because when the bass moves there, the bass really moves the air and, to top it all up. These are all nice, red and black finish. They look really good. They kind of match the mouse. That'S also been in the background of these videos. The cyborg rat 9 is red and black and they match the theme of my channel and I just love red and black. So I really can't say anything bad about these studio monitors. I gave the 8 inch version. The first-ever can out of 10. I ever gave a product review and these are also excellent studio monitors for an ear field, so you can check out the surprisingly affordable link in the description. If you want to buy a pair of these - and that's basically it make sure you give a thumbs up on this video, if you enjoy the sort of mini reviews that I'm probably going to start doing more often in between more major but yeah, that's basically it Review you guys have all been waiting for right there, yeah so I'll talk to you guys in the next video thanks for watching guys, you """
hE3XMbsneMk,Sony NEX-VG20 Review!,8:07,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kay PhD here, I'm back, and this is the Sony NEX V G 20. Let'S take a look if I had to describe this camera in just a few words, it would be the one that breaks all the rules. Think of it as a high-end DSLR and a high-end camcorder put together in one. Basically, it's a high-end DSLR sensor from Sony in a camcorders body, but with a DSLR mount that has interchangeable DSLR like lenses that are adapted for camcorder like video. It'S a crazy combination and I totally love it. This particular lens here is one of my favorites from Sony. It'S the 18 to 200 millimeter zoom lens that shoots at F 3.5 at its widest focal length, and it has a focus ring and a zoom ring just like a regular DSLR lens, so check it out. It gets pretty massive at 200 millimeters, but the autofocus here is present and it's incredible, but we'll get to that in a second either way. Up top is a very impressive microphone. Usually the built-in camcorder microphones are just terrible, but this one goes above and beyond anything. You'Ll find on other camcorders it records in Dolby, 5.1 channel surround sound and it does a great job at it too. The rest of the hardware is pretty self-explanatory. On the back, you have your on/off switch and your record button and the battery and up top is a an alternative, pinky record button and a photo button to take 16 megapixel stills. Yes, 16 megapixel good, looking still photos that I mean that's just due to the awesome DSLR sensor at work. That'S absolutely awesome for a camcorder battery life with the stock 2060 milliamp hour battery was decent. I got around 2 hours of her core time with it, and just overall build quality was rock-solid and you'd expect that from a camera, this price - you have your headphone jack for monitoring audio here USB IO HDMI the whole works, it's really nice and also the material That the outside shell is made of is pretty awesome too, and you can't forget that flip-out 3-inch touch screen LCD screen. It has a pretty basic menu system and a single SD card slot next to the manual controls would have liked to see two here or maybe a CF card, but I guess one SD card slot is fine, but when it comes down to it, you buy a Camera for the video quality and, like I said at the beginning, this camera is ridiculous. Too boss. It breaks all the rules, it has sharp autofocus and DSLR depth of field. It blew my mind. It just doesn't make any sense now. There are also adapters that let you use this with Canon and Nikon lenses and other sony alpha lenses, but I'm just gon na show you guys the footage I took with this stock 18 to 200 millimeter lens. So this is the Canon t2i that I'm using to record this right now and it's a crop sensor body at an equivalent of 48 millimeters, that's the focal length. So if out any further ado, let's go ahead and switch to the V g20 indoors. You don't really get a whole great sense of how capable this camera is. If I pulled something up to the camera, you can see the focus, the main power. The focus is that it's pretty average, but it's very, very tech sharp. So it's not fast, but it's really really sharp, but indoor footage like I said it doesn't really take the most advantage of this camera. So we're going to do is show you what it's capable of outdoors and just note as you're, watching this footage that this is all auto focusing on its own. That'S the beauty of this camera has a large sensor from a DSLR, combined with the focus of a regular camcorder, and it's basically like having autofocus for video on a 5d Mark 3. It'S absurd! So without any further ado, let's go ahead and take a look at that check this out guys. This is beautifully sharp video outdoors. Everything in focus is really really sharp and it's not even sunny and even more beautiful. Is this super soft bokeh you get in the background? You don't get that softness in the background from a regular camcorder. You just don't get that now. That is the DSLR sensor really working now. I know what you're thinking wow mkbhd. This is just general typical footage from a random object. Did you actually use this camera? Well, yes, if you were following me on Twitter at the link in the description right below the like button on this video, you would know that I have footage from an entire weekend of shooting outdoors in Wisconsin, enjoy [ Applause, ], [ Applause, ], [ Applause, ], [ Applause, ], [ Applause, ], Hey score - is now to one with Stevens. So overall I clearly love this camera and you can give a thumbs up on this video if you liked it too. Otherwise, the microphone is really impressive. The handles really convenient the eyepiece is really adjustable. The LCD the touchscreen is awesome. I really really like this camera and there hasn't been anything to stop me from buying one. So yeah just note that I really really like it and you may to either way thanks for watching this video guys hope it was enjoyable to you guys. If you want to check out the audio that I use the links to that and their in description and there's a link to check out the V g20 in the description, I want to put this down and I'll go ahead and sign off now. Talk to you guys later peace back to Mason, who knows something ugly, 100, John John Lee great snag so good job. """
yLZrBuNBQWc,HTC One X Review!,5:22,"The One X is HTC s attempt to throw absolutely everything they can at a single device and from the outside in it really shows - and this is a contender for one of the best smartphones of the year in 2012. No doubt so without any further ado. Let'S take a look at this quad-core beast so starting at the outside on the left. There is a microUSB port and on the right is just the volume rocker, which means up top. You have both the power button and, unfortunately the headphone jack. I say, unfortunately, because it should really be at the bottom, but that's okay. So the thing people talk about when they talk about the One X is a ridiculously good build quality. It'S built like a boss, precision, milled, unibody polycarbonate design, a very thin slightly curved body. A matte finish on the back and overall pretty sexy design up front. We have the 4.7 inch Super LCD display, that's kind of the star of the show, and I mean it's just really really thin. I mean look at that check that out. That'S very pocketable, no matter how big it looks so you're, looking at the back here, which is where you get that 8 megapixel camera with a flash which is nice and we'll get into that in a second and the speaker which claims to have Beats Audio. I mean, I guess, that's alright, it sounds fine to me, it's a cell phone speaker and up front and at the top they are these precisely milled holes for the cell phone speaker and one of these holes holds the notification light, which is pretty nice. A subtle touch and there's also that front facing camera, and all of this is in a package. That'S pretty easy to hold. You know doesn't feel that large to me at all. I mean that may be because I'm coming from the size of the Galaxy Nexus which I'm very used to, but they take up about the same footprint here. So that's nice, so yeah it passes the hardware test so onto the software now just FYI. This is the quad-core unlocked version of the One X, so it's running a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core Tegra 3 processor, which is just not fair. It'S just stupid fast. It flies through ICS and makes it look easy too. I can tell you that during everyday use, this was one of the most consistently impressively fast phones, I've ever used and that Tegra 3 clearly has no problems here and to top it all off. Some tasty benchmark results. Yeah like a boss, it's running Android 4.0. Point three and has the latest version of sense you eye version. For now some of us may not like this, and others may you know brings a lot of functionality. There are a lot of awesome, HTC, widgets included like the clock and some the crazy extra animation. Some gaudi visual effects and 3d twirly stuff, and, to be honest, some of you may like that. I happen to prefer a stock android, but hey if you like Sense, UI or if you don't mind it, that's totally cool it just helps a lot. If you already know what you're getting yourself into you, because HTC does change a lot around Android 4.0, as you can see, just kind of makes it its own little HTC Sense playground. If you will, anyway, I use it an app called CPU spy to check on that Tegra 3 and it looks like it can clock all the way down to 51 megahertz, but spends most of its time at 475 megahertz and what it really needs to push some Pixels, it hauls up to 1.4 gigahertz and sometimes 1.5. One way to get it to do that is to play a game, no, not Angry Birds. This is Riptide, GP, kicking it on a jet ski this time and yes, of course, the 1x handles it. Just fine. Very nice, so the screen has been awesome for gaming and just about everything else should look good on a massive 4.7 inch 1280 by 720 display. Now the blacks aren't as ink-black as the Samsung LED displays, but the detail and the brightness here on 1x are top-notch. So that's awesome and it's great for watching videos, full screen and all the other apps that should open full screen. However, these capacitive buttons down here at the bottom are nice, but there's no menu button. So when an app needs to have a menu button, you end up with this giant menu button at the bottom, which is kind of sad, and but you know it is what it is now. The last huge part of buying a phone. This nice is for the camera and believe me when I say this guy delivers. I mentioned this, has an 8 megapixel shooter on the back and you can take a look at the sample photos. I'Ll include some stuff in the description for you, but this is a very, very high-end camera for a smart phone. It also has this burst mode at 3.3. Frames per second takes 1080p. Video and overall is a really good performer, so I can definitely recommend us if you're looking for a high end camera in the 1x. So there you have it guys. It'S an overall an amazing package of very fast device, topped off with one of the most beautiful displays on the market and surrounded by awesome, high-quality hardware. So what more can I say other than give this review a thumbs up? If you want to see it compared to Samsung's quad-core flagship Galaxy s3, either way thanks for watching guys, I really appreciate the ratings and thank you for all the new subscribers welcome aboard, and I will talk to you guys in the next video thanks for watching peace.

fFRl2oOqDsk,Samsung Galaxy Nexus Review!,6:27,"A little more than 15 weeks ago, in December 2011, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus was launched on Verizon a 4G LTE phone with hardware by Samsung and software by Google. So it's been my primary handset since then - and this is the 100 % honest review of the Android phone that I waited so long for starting with the hardware, the only real concern that critics of this phone had at launch and also the Android haters with Samsung's Plastic back and I'm happy to report that it's still really durable. It'S not a problem. None of the glass on the back is cracked. It'S still in excellent condition, and one other thing to note was that shortly after I got the Nexus, I picked up the 2100 milliamp hour extended battery, which is just ever so slightly thicker than the stock eighteen hundred million power battery, but the difference is definitely worth It and it's still a very thin phone, but I get to battery life in a second but onto the front of the phone which I can tell you has proved to be. The best feature of the whole device is the four point: six five inch 1280 by 720 Super AMOLED HD display absolutely astounding. It'S that beautiful, having to display this big and amazingly crisp, pretty much a Retina display, makes it a pleasure to use for everything that smartphones should be good at it's comfortable. For me, I have big hands. I think anything over four point. Eight inches might be a little too big. I'Ve enjoyed as small as four inches on the incredible two and as large as 4.7 inches on the Titan, but four point: six five is comfortable, and all of that is exactly what she said, but seriously. This is still one of the best displays in the business and there's no denying that. So let me fill you in on the software side of things. This is a Nexus device which makes it exceptionally easy to unlock route and customize the daylights out of, and that's exactly what I've done here. I realized it was downright silly for me, someone who likes to take advantage of the customization of Android to stay with stock for so long. So I'm running Android 4.0 point four, with the a-ok peer um, a franko kernel that likes me overclocked to 1.3 gigahertz, and let me tell you this thing belies the rom is what allows me to get if you notable UI changes like the convenient toggles up here In the notification bar and the customized bottom navigation bar with the persistent menu button and the kernel is what makes it so stupid fast. I mean it feels brand new, but, like I said, this device is past 15 weeks old. The dual-core processor is more than capable of everything stock, but the kernel really takes it to the next level, and everything just feels liquid smooth like I just got it out the box. It opens apps quickly, it closes them quickly, even crashes quicker. Honestly, this isn't a stable signage and mod or anything, but you will notice the occasional force close and very discrete actions somewhere deep in the OS, but you'll be out of it in no time flat. So it just feels really great. I actually tried to get this thing to lag and, as you can see here, no chance, I think I think you get the point. This phone handles Ice Cream Sandwich like a boss, now Ice Cream Sandwich itself is pretty sweet if you're already an Android user. It'S really easy to fall in love with the new UI, but if you're coming from something silly simple like Windows, Phone or iOS, then yeah, you might think this is a little bit confusing, sometimes so give it a few days and you'll get through the learning curve. Just fine, the built-in apps are great they've proved to be very reliable, especially. I love Google Maps, which is really helpful for me, someone who goes a lot of places on foot and Google Maps walking directions. Navigation is pure awesome and, let's not forget the Play Store, which is full of great apps great third-party apps, constantly growing, with notable additions recently like Instagram and Temple Run and speaking of Temple Run. I'M not a huge phone gamer at all, I'm over productivity and utility person, but it's safe to say looking at this, that gaming will go just fine on this beauty of the screen. I think I've made that point already and so will movie watching and YouTube video watching when it's full screen 1280 by 720. It'S just hard to get over how rich that AMOLED display. Is it amazes me literally, every day, some days I found myself using the Nexus to catch up on my YouTube subscriptions more than I do on my tablet or on my computer. Also, a major buying point for some people on a smartphone is a camera's picture quality and I have an entire video dedicated to this and that'll be in the description right below that. Like help with the summit up, it's pretty decent, the instant shutter is really nice. Convenient and the front-facing camera is great for Google, Hangouts or Skype, or even face unlock yeah face unlock you catch that unlocking it within the face, and there are just some things that Android does really really well like notifications, for example, it just doesn't get any better Than that, it's an amazing system battery life all day every day, and did I mention that screen so overall, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus easily one of the best phones, I've ever used and I'm really glad it's my own contract phone. I'M not saying I'm not looking forward to stuff like the Samsung Galaxy s3, but just little things about Android like, for example, the ability to go and look at how much mobile data you're using on your device. Little things, maybe like the ability to sync bookmarks from Google Chrome. The Galaxy Nexus is absolutely a very nice device, even if you were to buy one today unlocked for somewhere around $ 450 absolutely recommended, like I said in the video one of the biggest reasons you buy a nexus is because it's so easy to unlock and customize And to use a custom ROM, and that's definitely what I've done using a okp here on Android 4.0.4. Oh, that a brief summary would be awesome display really really really really fast and pretty much an awesome all-around device. Thanks for watching this review, video guys of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus hope you enjoyed it, give it a thumbs up. In fact, if you liked this video, as that really does help out the mkbhd channel and I'll go ahead and sign off here and I'll talk to you guys in the next video thanks for watching case, you """
fDCumhEKerw,TokyoFlash Night Vision Watch!,2:47,"Hey what's up guys mkbhd here in the last video, when I said I was taking a look at a pretty special gadget. I wasn't kidding. This is the night vision watch from Tokyo, flash who's, apparently pretty popular already. Now I've never been a watch person and I'm guessing you aren't either because after all, you can just whip your phone out your pocket and tell what time it is, but there's something special about this watch. That makes it worth having more than a regular watch. But we'll get to that in a second, the design of this watch, or I guess what we could call the hardware is absolutely rock-solid. Literally. This thing is built like a tank, it has a completely a metal exterior, so water-resistant up to 3 meters glass face metal links, it's all Abbas, you can barely even scratch this thing and also I can take a sidestep and say this looks classy like formal attire, Classy, I think, but seriously that hexagon, that glass, so good-looking, but the real magic happens when you turn the watch on you ready boom. Just look at it. Look at that dang! Okay, wait, wait, wait! Hold your horses! Let'S take a second look. It'S actually really simple check this out around the outside of the watch. There are 12 bars one for each hour on the clock, so the third ones blinking it's the third hour. The LEDs in the middle indicate the minutes 18 minutes. So it's 3:18 no math required. Now it's a lot friendlier. Doesn'T it does that look great yeah, I thought so now. If you look carefully, there are actually two buttons on the side of the watch. The top one tells you the time and then there's this bottom one, and when you press the bottom one it will display the date. The same way: twelve bars for the 12 months and the middle LEDs are the day of the week. So there you go now. You know what day I'm making this video so now I've got enough practice. You should be able to tell the time at a glance right. So here's your practice, ready yeah. Did you get it? Let me know if you can tell the time in the comment section below now. This watch is obviously battery powered, but it's or a chargeable battery, so you can recharge if I, this small port on the bottom left and there's an included USB cable to power. It up and the battery lasts about a month per charge, so it's pretty good and it can have a raging party with your microwave. So you know you're in business, so there it is guys. This is the night vision watch. If you have anything more to say, you can use that comment box below the links are in the description, enjoy your crazy variety of watches to choose from, and I will talk to you guys in the next video thanks for watching.

v8WRJSBi6E4,Blue Spark Microphone Review!,3:26,"Hey, what's up guys, welcome to a sort of a peek inside the mkbhd audio setup so thumbs up. If you like this today, we're taking a look at this, the blue spark microphone, and yes, it's orange okay. Now that we got that out the way, this is the microphone that you seen or heard me using in the past few videos and for my experience with it, this mic is absolutely top-notch quality everything about this microphone from the packaging down to the body of the Mic and the chromed metal materials just screams high quality. Now the most important feature about this microphone is that it's an XLR microphone and you can get this XLR cable from just about anywhere I'll leave a link in the description. Now some of you guys might be staring at your computer like whoa where's that port - I don't have that. Well, don't fret! Your computer probably does not have an XLR port. So this here is the blue icicle. Any audio interface will do, and this will convert from analog to digital, which is XLR to USB, and the mic also comes with this magnificent shock mount, which is also all metal and isolates the mic from extra vibrations and stuff. That can cause noise and it comes with this sweet pop filter. It looks cool, I didn't think it would work, but I mean I mean just look at it, but it actually has worked surprisingly well, but just look at that body, but seriously check out the body on that that is per classy right there, but the most important Part of having a microphone and why you spend all the money on it is how it sounds. So how does it sound? You tell me you listening to it right now. This is a blue spark plug directly in via the XLR cable to the icicle directly into USB in my computer. I think it sounds pretty good if you want to know my opinion, but obviously you're listening to it. Listen to this video in 1080p and you put headphones on, you might be able to hear my roommate breathing in the background. Each probably keep that down. There'S a great microphone for vocals because it is a large diaphragm condenser microphone, which means it gets a full dynamic range of your voice and also I'm using it with the focus mode off right now. So if you have a particularly deep voice like really deep voice, you'll get all the bass tones in your voice and it'll sound, really really rich and just come through the microphone. There is literally zero background noise and that's thanks to it. First of all, being really high quality and also having a good USB in XLR, cable, so yeah I'd recommend this spark to just about anyone who's getting into entry-level XLR microphones. I did a video previously on my DAC, which is a digital to analog converter. It'S another audio thing: you should probably check out if you're into audio and a sweet pair of headphones. So there you go nice pair of headphones nice audio interface, you pretty much set for audio for me so far uh-hum, unless you have any other requests in the comments below but yeah tell me how you think it sounds either way I'll talk to you guys in The next video, the link to the lowest price, is in the description of this video right next to the thumbs up button so even thumbs up. If you enjoyed thanks for watching guys, you """
R3n_J7v82AM,iPad 3 vs Transformer Prime!,6:28,"This is the Battle of the two heaviest hitting tablets on the market today in 2012, the new iPad 3 and the Asus Transformer Prime and the iPad is the boss of all iOS devices, and the transformer prime is the king of all Android tablets and from a Purely hardware perspective they are pretty similar slabs of glass from the outside, now to be fair, just to get out the way. The transformer prime is the thinner of the two tablets and it is the lighter of the two by just a few ounces, not the substantial difference, but now you know and both have their own unique, very high quality metal backs, that's actually a trademark and probably why They are so expensive and comparing button layouts you'll see that the power button and volume rockers are in a same spot on both tablets, pretty much linked together and on the front. The transformer prime is a 10.1 inch sheet of glass, while the iPad is a slightly smaller 9.7 inch sheet of glass and a home button. You also have cameras on the back of these badboys, a 5 megapixel on the back of the iPad and an 8 megapixel camera on the back of the transformer. But honestly it's a tablet. I mean they both take decent photos and they both take it at a decent speed. The interface is fine, but nothing to write home about. I mean I'm sure we're all familiar with the fact that taking pictures on a tablet is forbidden among geeks I mean come on, you look ridiculous, I mean a juice. Might as well use your face. I mean you'd, look just as dumb. I like really but honestly, the front-facing cameras on these two devices are far more useful for stuff, like Google, Hangouts and FaceTime calls. But, as we all know, this isn't just the iPad 3 versus the transformer prime. This is also Apple's new dual core: a 5x chip with quad-core graphics versus Nvidia's, quad-core, Tegra 3 chip with tons of cores of graphics. So we know that we have some performance tests here. I started out with less intensive app equivalents on both devices and work. My way up in intensity as you can see, but what I basically found was that in real world use used to perform very, very close to each other, sometimes the iPad would pull ahead. You know render a webpage quicker and maybe be a little bit more responsive on a website and other times. The transformer prime would open a few apps faster and be just better in some other categories. But as you can see here, it was never like a substantial difference where I would just sit back and say wow this Tegra 3 just destroyed the iPad with quad core, or, I would never say, wow this. I fed this. A 5 X just blows the Tegra 3 out of the water. I never ever find myself saying that. Don'T believe what you see in these silly cross-platform benchmarks: they're, almost, never completely accurate, so pay attention to what you see in real life and both obviously offer a ton of top-of-the-line snappy performance. So it's all good. So I'll get these just worked very, very well. You'Ve probably already seen my transformer prime review, where I was playing this game here. It'S called Riptide GP and this is great way to show off the graphics on this 10.1 inch screen 1280 by 800 lots of pixels and it drives it very, very well good stuff. Tegra 3. The new iPad has a few internal upgrades to help to keep up with four times as many pixels at 2048 by 1536 display. So it gets a little bit warm. It has a larger battery, but overall graphics still look great and the game I'm playing here on. The iPad is called Real Racing. 2 HD and I got ta say I am a mouse at this game, even in the crappiest of cars, to send oh yeah. Oh yeah just look at that so aggressive, but none of this means anything can't connect to the internet. Huh. Both of these have had minor Wi-Fi issues. They both have a metal back, so that was kind of the deal when people are trying to figure out. Hey does this not have as good internet connection, but overall I got decent results, so it's nothing really to worry about on either of these tablets. Also, the battery life between these two tablets was a bout, the same easily six or seven hours of regular use, though the iPad has a larger battery, which means it's going to take longer to charge it fully. That'S just simple physics so, which one do you get? Well, I got ta say it mostly depends on whether you like it the dead, easy simplicity of iOS 5.1 or the quirky, but kind of fun and customisable sophistication of Android 4.0. There are a couple reasons why I love Android so much. I use a lot of Google services like Google Talk, Google Voice Calendar and YouTube, so it helps that I have Android, but the funny thing is widgets dude. You have no idea how awesome widgets on Android are until you don't have them anymore. I swear. Widgets are very, very useful, pretty underrated right now, but I got to say the most compelling reason to get the iPad 3 is easily easily the Retina display I'd say it's even a reason to sell your iPad 1 or 2. Most of you don't know this. I'Ve had an iPad 2 for about two weeks a little while ago, just testing it out, but it didn't really impress me and I returned it, but I would actually rather have an iPad 3 than an iPad 2 having used them both with this new 2048 by 1536 display, I actually think that it is worth that upgrade now, keep in mind. The new transformer prime infinity is going to be coming out, hopefully in April, and is going to have in 1920 by 1200 HD display, which is also kick-ass, so stay tuned. For my review of that tablet, but until then this is absolutely the king of mobile displays and thumbs up to Apple, just very well done on this IPS display. But in my opinion, you can't go wrong with either of these they're the kings of their kingdoms and they deserve their titles. So it's your cash put your money where your heart is so there you have it guys. The choice is yours: iPad, 3 or Asus Transformer Prime and hey: leave it thumbs up on this video. If you enjoyed it, the ratings really do help out a lot, and I will talk to you guys in the next video thanks for watching """
1Ij-_XD8tXQ,Asus Zenbook UX31 Review!,4:14,"Hey, what's up guys mkbhd here back with a video taking a look at one of the slimmest, most well-built ultra books that you can buy right now, we're taking a look at the Asus Zenbook ux301 go ahead and give it a thumbs up on this video. If you enjoy it and without any further ado, let's get right into this one. All right, I'm gon na go ahead and start this off by saying the Zenbook ux301 is a picture, perfect definition of an ultrabook, and in case you didn't already know I'll - include a link in the description as Zenbook. In order to be called an ultrabook needs to fit a certain number of qualifications, and this does just that. You can see it's razor thin and it has a nice tapering design to it from back to front. But this one separates itself from other, possibly tapering. Laptops check us out on the right hand, side you have a USB 3.0 port, okay, 3.0 power, mini VGA and mini HDMI ports and a battery charging light and, on the left hand side. You have another USB port, a headphone jack and a memory card reader, and they can get a good look at that nice, solid, tapering design. So there's nothing on the bottom of the laptop and the battery. While it's non removable is actually pretty good. So it wasn't a problem and the whole laptop. Is this nice spun metal finish? That'S just just screams slick or something I don't know. It'S hot reminds me of the transformer prime actually uh-huh, but there's no ports on the back of this laptop either, which is perfect. The way it should be so all you have is this hinge, and I can tell that Asus spent time designed it properly put the right parts in the right places just so that it could do this. Oh yeah boss, does your laptop do that? I didn't think so. Okay, so once you open it up, you get the keyboard, the trackpad and the screen, and this is where you can make or break it here in a laptop the keyboard. It'S alright, it's not the best i've ever used, but it's definitely not. The worst there's a little bit of flex, but not much because it's metal and the size of the keyboard was fine for even my mammoth sized hands and there's function, keys and everything they work great with Windows. The keyboard is pretty good and the display was right on. I might not be a fan of glossy on the desk, but they pulled it off here with a 13.3 inch 1600 by 900 IPS panel. The viewing angles were decent, but the screen actually gets really really bright, which is nice for using it outdoors and a trackpad. No, it's just bad. I mean it's a it's big and smooth and has nice hidden buttons and everything, but for some reason, mine just wasn't that sensitive at all. It was really weird. I don't know if it was just mine or maybe too much - I maybe I'm a mouse and keyboard kind of guy, but I feel like if you're getting an ultra portable laptop, you don't really want to carry around a secondary Mouse. You know so the keyboard and the trackpad should be really top-notch, but this trackpad. Let me down. It worked okay with windows gestures, but I would have preferred a more sensitive keyboard and trackpad. I feel like it could use a firmware update or something so inside. The beast: we have Windows, 7 home premium and an Intel Core i5 25:57 m at 1.7 gigahertz. So you know what that means. You can do work on this thing. It'S an ultra-low voltage processor, so battery lasts well, but performance doesn't lag behind even a split. Second, the graphics were snappy and it's responsive to everything I threw at it, including editing a video while plugged in in power mode, but still I'm convinced that the 128 gig SSD in this laptop had a lot to do with that. Also, the speakers were really loud. It surprised me it kind of blew me away actually, but I'd like to see more of the technology they used in these speakers in more mobile devices. I liked it a lot and all this comes in a 17 millimeter thin package. I don't have to tell you which one's the Ultrabook, at least, I hope, not peace out, guys """
fQqdHfUVOiI,Asus Transformer Prime Dock!,5:43,"All right ever since I reviewed the Asus Transformer Prime a couple weeks ago, I've gotten a lot of questions about the dock. I mean it's called the transformer after all, so what exactly does it transform into and how good is it? The tablet is, without a doubt, a boss, I mean, I think we settled that in the review, but can it transform into a full laptop replacement? Let'S check this out, introducing the Asus Transformer Prime TF, 201 plus its dock. First of all, the dock itself is actually pretty impressive. It'S a little bit smaller than a full size keyboard, yes, but the keys are actually pretty comfortable to type on despite their size, and you can also see that there are a number of Android specialty keys. So, on the left hand side you have a dedicated home button and a dedicated search button and on the right hand, side you get arrow keys and a dedicated Android Menu button and up top is a smashing array of buttons. We have a back button: a Wi-Fi toggle, a Bluetooth toggle, a trackpad, lock, brightness controls and an auto brightness button, a camera shortcut, a browser shortcut, a settings, shortcut, media, playback and controls with volume, and your lock / unlock button, which I actually found to be the Most useful of them all brilliant. It also adds a full-size USB port to the tablet. Yes full size, I'm looking at you other tablet, along with its own charging port and LED on the left hand, side. It has its own charging port because it has an internal battery which it does charge and dispense first. So when you're hooked up to the tablet with the keyboard, I found that it uses the dock battery, then the tablet battery. So when you can, you know, use the tablet for hours while it's plugged in pop off the keyboard and still have a hundred percent battery left on the tablet. So that's always really nice. So, thanks to all of your comments, of course, I was actually wondering to myself: can this replace a laptop? Is there enough power here? Is there enough functionality, so I hooked it up and well. I got to trying to use it trackpad and all, and it actually got pretty crazy. I found myself flying through the UI opening apps searching stuff and using the hardware keys the way I wouldn't have even thought of before having this keyboard. Multi-Touch gestures were also especially impressive, as the trackpad supports long press tapped, a click and multi-touch for easy navigation, around Android, 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich how but seriously this was pretty pleasant to use and was really nice, as you can still use the touchscreen and the keyboard At the same time, so you know stuff like the multitasking button or stuff you want to do on the screen. They still work, so it all blends together in a very dynamic, wicked one-of-a-kind experience that I really enjoyed a lot now. As you probably know, Asus also happens to make some well-respected, ultrabooks and lightweight laptops, and the most Awkward part of the comparison was actually brace yourself. Opening it up, laptops built to be laptops, are weighted and built just right to open up just like in the commercials, that is sexy tablets that aren't built to be laptops, and not so much I mean maybe I'm nitpicking now, but that happened to bug me a Lot that it wasn't that easy to open. So in the end it kind of begs the question: does the transformer prime, with the dock, compete with a full fledged laptop? Well, to be fair, it does match some of the features that netbooks or ultrabooks these days have, including the instant on feature ultrabooks with SSDs can resume from sleep in maybe 2 to 3 to 4 seconds, and actually opening up the transformer prime it'll actually resume from Sleep in maybe less than 1, second, typically so yeah to be fair, it matches that feature, there's also the thinness factor. A lot of ultrabooks are very, very thin to make them portable and also light and well-built joshan, where Prime is not really that much different. It'S very very thin. The dock is very thin so put together. They are really well connected and a pretty solid, well-built and lightweight portable machine. So so far, it's looking pretty good and, let's not forget that the transformer prime and the transformer prime dock put together still probably cost less than the machine you're watching this on it's very inexpensive compared to most laptops. So can it replace your laptop? Well, here's the thing look at what you do on your laptop. If you do pretty light consumption right now, maybe watching YouTube videos, even answering emails. Reading emails, we're processing, sometimes some light photo editing. You'Re gon na be just fine with the transformer prime handles all that and the Tegra 3 is an absolute boss, so you won't have full-size apps, like you know, Microsoft, Word or Photoshop, or just heavy hitters like that. But if you don't need that you know take a look in the Android Market and if you find the apps that you want and they actually work for you you'll be set. The laptop the transformer prime most closely resembles is the Samsung Chromebook. I mean, if you think about it, the transformer prime is really a quad-core Chromebook, either way. If you enjoyed this video thanks for watching, I hope it helped you out, if you're considering this particular purchase, give a thumbs up on this leave a thumbs up on this video. I'D really appreciate it and thanks for all the the ratings and the subscriptions guys really do appreciate every single one of you so like I said thanks for watching this video and I'll talk to you next time, MVP HP, signing out peace, """
et_PWifUd1w,Beats Pro vs Audio Technica ATH-M50!,5:00,"The audio technica ath em 50s are among the finest headphones under $ 200 and have been compared to headphones of a much higher price and still come out on top, but on video they've never been compared to monsters very finest they're top-of-the-line beats pros until now. So just as a preview, I have the lowest prices I can find in the description below this video, but as of right now, the m50 s run around a hundred and sixty dollars, while monsters beats by dre run up around four hundred dollars. So, with the build the m50 s are a very highly adjustable and pretty comfortable pair of headphones. Actually, I've worn them for hours on end doing all kinds of audio stuff and they're pretty soft on the inside and overall, their build quality is right where it should be. The beats pros are a very rigid pair of headphones. On the other hand, you can see that they're made almost entirely out of aluminum, so they're very, very sturdy, but that means that they also don't adjust as much and they do try to make up for that. With this very, very, very soft material on the headband and in the ear cups, but they still hurt my head after listening for a shorter period of time than an 50s did, both pairs of headphones are adjustable. They have these little notches on the side, so you can adjust them to the size of your head, which is nice, especially if you have a huge head or a massive, never mind anyway. One of the weird quirks about the beat pros is that they have a rigid circular ear cup, which is not the natural shape of the ear. The m50 is actually fit better with more of an oval ear Cup and another Hardware difference between the two that actually goes in favor of the beats. This time is that the m50 s don't have a removable audio cable, while the beats pros have two audio jacks and a removable cable which allows you to daisy chain, multiple, headphones together and listen to the same audio source. That being said, the cables itself are mostly the same. Just the monster. Cable is red, yes, red, oh and the cable is a bit shorter, with the beats and also just FYI. The beats pros have a special feature that DJs around the world will probably never use, but they can swivel ear cuffs back. As you can see, honestly, it's not that hard to just brush your hand back and move the the ear cup back without the hinge, but hey it's it's a feature for your for inner DJ. No! But I've honestly never seen someone buy a pair of headphones for this feature, but it could be you you could be that Mouse, you, boss mode boss, level type bow status, bow. Okay, I'm done both pairs of headphones. Come with these soft carrying pouches the monster cable. One being a little bit more flashy red and black and everything with the audio technica, one being a little bit more subdued just a chilled gray color, but when it really all comes down to it, people are in it for one main reason and that's audio quality. That'S why people spend hundreds of dollars on headphones is because they're trying to get better sound quality generally and, to be perfectly honest, the m50 sound better than the Beats prosed. Hmm. I thought I was gon na get punched in the face for saying that high five or don't hit your screen just or thumbs up on this video. Do you know how many people I see walking around like this like this and like this seriously really, then I even plugged in you're making these a $ 400 fashion accessory a $ 400 necklace. Please don't do that. I admit it in this swag category. These are hands-down amazing. Looking okay, I got it. I can't do this anymore. These are amazing. Looking headphones, they are hands-down classy. Bravo, these are sexy. If you value that category at all yeah, these are excellent headphones, but in every other category it's the em 50s that take the top mark and that's really where the value comes in is when you really decide how much you're going to spend on headphones and where You'Re going to put your money yeah, that's what you want to consider. So what I'm asked, which is better! I generally recommend the EM 50s to people who value sound the most. So the N fifties have a very balanced, very accurate, very crisp, punchy, sound, very rich bass. These make excellent studio, monitors people who want to listen to music and hear things that they've never heard in a song before that were mixed in. If you value this rock solid, build quality and you don't mind paying a little extra for the name, and you know you really don't like the looks of the EM 50s and you don't mind the slightly overpowering bass or the lack of mids and some of the Comfort issues and you don't mind the price premium, then you should probably go with the beats pros either way, there's been mkbhd if you like this video, give it a thumbs up. That really does help me out, and I appreciate it and just a quick shout-out. Thank you guys for all the people who have subscribed to my videos at the past couple weeks. It'S been quite an interesting growth pattern, but good to see you guys new people on board either way. Thanks for watching this, video and uh mkbhd signing out peace. """
ngEoQzIqHMc,Chrome Beta for Android!,4:26,"Hey, what's up guys mkbhd here and welcome to the definitive video to send your friends to on facebook, twitter or google of the new google chrome beta for android. So this is, as of today, the newest release of a browser on Android from Google itself, go ahead and open it up and take a look at it for the first time as yes, it was released today, if anything is the most compelling reason to use Chrome On the desktop, you know it's a fast browser, it's a secure browser and it's coming to mobile here and you'll see. There has been a few interesting changes right off the bat. There are some user interface changes. First of all, there's some really weird tab. Switching on going on here so first of all, I can swipe to the right to go in my next tab, which is pretty sweet here. You can see how Facebook open I have Google open and I have a google.com tab here. I also have a Settings tab. What I can also do is hit that multiple tabs button here and you'll see I have this interesting accelerometer controlled way of flipping through my tabs and revealing what tabs I have open. So I can go straight to Facebook straight to Google and just flip around between the tabs here, which is kind of interesting, and I like it in this tab. You view you can also exit a tab here or just swipe it out and never have to look at it again. You can also open new tabs, of course, to view other stuff, but if there's any really compelling reason to use Chrome - and I'm serious about this - because it's finally come to mobile - is the settings now, there's some pretty crazy stuff going on in here. So I'll show you, when you're signed in to Chrome, as you probably are on your desktop, you have your Google account hooked up and that'll be able to sync all your bookmarks, while your history and all sorts of settings and things like that to your phone. Second of all is auto sign-in, which we would expect so, if you're signed in to Facebook on your desktop site - and you don't want to have to remember that password. This will remember the password as well as soon as you sign in and if you're, not a fan of that crazy tilt scrolling, you can disable it in developer tools. The single most important version - and this is just on the phone of the settings - is the other devices button and I'll go ahead and show you right now. This is the transformer prime TF, oh one in the background, and it's letting me know that two minutes ago I had Google open, so I can go ahead and write open, Google Plus that was open on the transformer prime without any sort of delay, because it knows That'S what's open on the transformer prime, but there are some other things that are different on the tablet. So let's go ahead and switch over to tablet view and check out what's different there. So now we're here on the tablet and you can see that first of all the Nexus was right. I do have Google open here on the tablet and if you want any further proof will go to other devices here and it'll. Tell us what the Galaxy Nexus is running and sure enough. It'S Google and the new tab page and that's totally correct, but what you'll notice is also interesting is this is showing the mobile version of the website and that's because, as of right now, there is no request desktop site option as there was in a stock browser. So that's one of the cons and the other con which I'll go ahead and get out the way right now is that Adobe Flash is not supported. So if you were hoping to be able to use your desktop sites that were full of Adobe Flash stuff, that's not going to work right off the bat, at least right now in Google Chrome for Android. If you're, ok with all the rest of that and you like the tab, switching Google Chrome actually looks like a bit of a desktop browser when you're using it on your tablet. You can see it looks it kind of resembles Chrome for Mac. Actually, I can say that, because I use Chrome for Mac now - and it looks very very similar to that - also if we go back into our settings here again, you'll find the same sort of settings here. You can sign in to your Google account and sync everything like your bookmarks history. Everything is the same and it does resemble a desktop experience, so I would say if anyone is looking forward to using such a very high-end tablet, you should go with a high-end browser, and so far Google Chrome has looked to be like that either way, there's been Mkbhd with a quick video, google, chrome beta for Android, 4.0 and above devices, so I'll keep you updated if this is updated to a later version or if it's changes significantly either way. That'S been mkbhd thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace """
wkmL7KyNn3o,Cyborg RAT 7 Review!,3:57,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kay PhD here with the cyborg rat 7 Mouse now just FYI! This is coming to you before part two of the world's fastest Mac miniseries, because I am waiting on the SSD to ship. So I can do that video, but I figured I'd, show you guys the mouse that I'm using and that I will be using full time with the Mac Mini. This is obviously not your ordinary Mouse, not a Magic Mouse, not a Magic Trackpad, but it's the cyborg rat 7 and, as you guys can see this mouse or rat, I should say, is an absolute beast. So just having this thing on, your desk draws a lot of questions like what's that beautiful monster Batmobile looking thing connected to your computer, but there's a reason behind these looks as you can probably already figure out. This is hands-down the most customizable Mouse I have ever seen. If you can show me one more adjustable than a rat 7. Well, please show me, but until then I give this a title. This gets the crown of the most customizable peripheral. So yes, this mouse will work for people with massive hands or tiny paws huh, so pretty much any size or shape hand will work, and it's also yet adjustable to the point where you can take the back off. Obviously so that's step one step: two is the screw in the back of the mouse and if you unscrew it enough, this spring will release and it gives you access to five small weights in the bottom of the mouse. So you can leave them all in and have a heavy Mouse or take them all out and have a very light Mouse or use one or two or three. If you want, you got to get the weight perfect of course, so whatever you choose to decide, you can screw it back in and have that amount of weight now the rat is super duper light step. Three in case you don't read the instruction manual yeah. That'S a hexa screwdriver unscrew earthing, so that means you can use it to adjust or even completely remove the pinky wrist. That'S on the right hand, side of the mouse. Naturally, you get two or three choices of pinky rests when you buy it, so you can look at the link in the description to buy it, so you can choose to have no pinky rest at all. Just by unscrewing it step four means you can also use the hex. A bang is just the thumb. Rest, you can't take the thumb rest completely off, but you certainly can tilt it. What looks like about 15 degrees left or right so to get into your own comfort zone, but what better way to tour a mouse then to count buttons? Oh, we can start with the red button on the left hand, side, which is basically a sniper button. So when you hold it down, it lowers the DPI and slows the cursor way down for those headshots or video editing or anything else precise. You also have the forward and backward buttons. You can use these in the browser, along with the side scrolling wheel, which is always fun at the top. You have a profile switcher, which goes between three profiles: red, blue and pink, and they are all customizable in the software in the middle, you have a dpi rocker, which will move the sensitivity of the mouse up or down and indicate that with lights, on the side Of the mouse, so that'll go up all the way from the lowest to the highest sensitivity. And finally, you have the right and left click and the scroll wheel for those of you counting at home. That makes this a nine button. Mouse like a bow so yeah, the rat will work on just about any platform will adjust to just about any size or any shape hand and as a bonus, it kills all the bugs in your room at night. The only downside is, it transforms into a car, a Ferrari, so you're gon na have to pay for gas and stuff. Now I'm just kidding guys this is this is a top-notch peripheral. I highly recommend it unless you're a lefty ahead I'll keep you updated on the world's fastest Mac Mini series, which will hopefully be our next video and until next time, mkbhd signing out peace.

WBdJ6X1hp-U,Asus Transformer Prime Review!,6:21,"Hey, what's up guys mkbhd here and today we're taking a look at the first tablet running Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich the first quad-core mobile device today we're taking a look at our full review of the Asus Transformer Prime. First of all, this thing features probably the best build quality of any tablet on the market. To date, it has a spun metal finish on the back, where it houses that 8 megapixel camera and a flash and has a solid array of ports from the volume rocker. The mini HDMI port, the microSD card slot and the power button up top along with that microphone and on the other side of the three-and-a-half millimeter headphone jack, with the very impressive speaker which I'll detail in a second and all of that comes in a package. Just 8.3 millimeters thin, which is thinner, then even the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, but don't let those specs fool you and may be really thin and really light, but it feels really good in the hand just messing around with it, maybe in a store or something you'll, probably Be able to tell and with build quality like that, it makes it ideal for just lounging back and watching movies or just YouTube. Videos on that 10.1 inch 1280 by 800, Super LCD display and when I say Super LCD, that's not only a complement to the quality and the viewing angles, but the thing also gets really bright. Like 600 nits bright, like most computer monitors, only go up to 300 or 350 nits, so you can read this thing in sunlight, unlike some other tablets out there, but yeah. This has an excellent display. So, of course, what we love about, the transformer prime, is the Tegra 3 chipset powers, this thing, along with liquid smoothness and fluidity. As you can see, it's a quad-core chip, but it has a fifth core running at a slightly lighter clock, speed of 500 megahertz to take core of stuff, like in the background like swiping between home screens and just running background tasks and little stuff like this. And this actually saves battery life a lot. I get great battery life because it offsets all the stuff that would normally be on the one-point three gigahertz quad-core chip for the more demanding stuff, so Android 4.0 is just like. Like I mean, I can't even describe how good it is it's like if Google hired me to find something wrong with Ice Cream Sandwich I'd be fired. That'S it's amazing! It'S beautiful everything right from the design right down to the font. The Roboto font is absolutely well executed, so props to Google for Android 4.0 doing a really good job with this one. Now, just as a side note, if you are running an Android 4.0 device, go ahead, go to your settings, go down to developer settings and click. Ok and enable force GPU rendering this is what's giving me the liquid smooth performance with the apps that aren't ICS enabled yet so stuff like twitta. You can go through this really smooth scrolling stuff, like Spotify all apps, for phones, work, amazingly well, and if you enable this on your 4.0 smartphone you're, also gon na get really smooth performance in a lot of apps. Now something I've been asked. A lot about was a browser performance on the transformer prime and it's been a mixed bag. Sometimes it looked at the website. You'Re visiting it says me, you know this is a light web site and I don't have to put a lot of horsepower into it. So it doesn't - and you might find yourself on the single core for light stuff, but you might get to a heavy website like this and pinching and scrolling might become more difficult. So you need to trust that that quad core power is gon na kick in. For those bigger websites and the more heavy tests and stuff, so I found the easiest way to get good performance was to have multiple tabs open, but generally the stock browser was pretty good. There'S some nice features in it from Ice Cream Sandwich and it handles Adobe Flash just fine, so it gives a pretty nice overall great web experience. Now I've also gotten more involved with gaming on the transformer prime, you thought I was gon na open, Angry Birds. Didn'T you no, but but this holy buns this is insane absolutely ridiculous. It blew my mind. This Tiger 3 really shines here, like nothing in Tegra, 2 could ever cover. In fact, this is one of the one times I wish I still had my zoom, so I could compare and show you guys just how much slower it was playing these same games in a lower quality. I'M telling you the video, doesn't even do it. Justice, rich high-definition, graphics and fast response times to movement and touch are like nothing. I have ever seen before fricking props, to Nvidia for this one. It sounds like they paid me to say that I mean yeah. They probably should have actually but seriously guys look at it. Just look at it's beautiful anything. You can see the water splashing on the game in this in the screen is just ABS meetable, so you can definitely expect to get awesome. Gaming performance and a great experience from gaming on the transformer prime hands-down, the best Android gaming tablet. I promise in fact, let's wait a sec. Let'S, let's go over this bump in the water here. Ah, oh yeah, hey look at the water that splashed up on the screen. That is just awesome. Riptide GP by the way, is the name of the game. If you want to check it out so now you know the transformer Prime's got it all covered. It has an office suite for businessmen and it's got a ton of great games in the Android Market for leisure, the ever-growing android market. I hope to get my hands on the dock soon, to take a detailed look at that. But until then this is the transformer prime. You know it's had a few quirks like people complaining about Wi-Fi strength and GPS lock. The GPS issue was fixed with a recent firmware update, while the Wi-Fi issue, while it's never cut out on me, has always been a tad little bit weaker because of the metal body and the speaker and the speaker. It'S like someone at asus thought: hey dude. What'S the most inconvenient place, we can possibly put a speaker right here where they hold the tablet right right, where they put their hand. Okay, that's exactly where we'll put it, but honestly the speaker has a really good quality that makes up for it and it's pretty loud. So overall, really, this is the best tablet money can buy. So if you got 500 bucks sitting on the monitor underneath you're watching this video on, you should hand that to me right now or go pick up a 32 gig Wi-Fi transformer prime, it's available in either gray or gold. Hey thanks for watching this full review and if you enjoyed it, please go ahead and give it a thumbs up. I really do appreciate the rating, and thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys in a bit """
kPoPZ4L8O5A,Bose Companion 2 Series II Speaker Review!,4:12,"Hey, what's up guys is Marquez from mkbhd and today we're taking a look at the bose companion, 2 series. 2 speakers that I believe are really great for the price you get them for 99 bucks. So if you want to check that out, that's in the description below we're starting off with the set up of those here and basically how we're going to get started here is by unboxing them, of course, so it foams up for that. Basically, one of the reasons people buy speakers is so that they can have a quick, easy audio solution, even if it's not difficult to set up and for 99 bucks. That is exactly what these do. They'Re. Surprisingly, simple for the price, as you can see, we take them out here we can unbox them and setting them up is as quick as just a few steps taking them out of the wrapping. For the first time, you'll notice, the series two are built, like tanks they're made from a magnetically shielded plastic cabinet on the outside, and we'll show that more off later. You also notice that one of the speakers has all the controls on the circuitry, while the other is well a companion, so it comes with this wall adapter. That looks a little bit odd at first, but basically it comes with the plug from the country. You live in so plug that into the wall, plug your main speaker into the wall and plug your companion speaker into the main speaker that plug into the wall and connect your audio source to the main speaker as well. You can connect up to two audio sources. It comes with one cable, but you might want to attach a second one in the future. These speakers have great efficiency, so they'll generally run really loud and really clear. Without an amp. I'Ve listened to a lot of hours of audio on these $ 99 bose speakers. I'Ve also listened to a lot of hours of audio on $ 600 Aiki audio studio monitors and on $ 29 earbuds right. So that's a pretty full range. But what does 99 bucks get you out of bose? What kind of value are you gon na get out of $ 99 bose speakers so during my time owning these speakers so far, I've learned a lot about why people like them a lot about the speaker's themselves and about a lot about why they cost 99 bucks. They have a pretty decent, build quality, they're, pretty durable. The cables are really durable and they aren't breaking anytime soon and also the cabinet is magnetically shielded, so you can have it right next to a monitor with no problem. I was a little bit concerned about the cabinet size because the only speaker itself in the companion, 2 series 2 is a 2 and 1/2 inch driver up at the top. So the two and a half inch speaker is the only speaker in each side. So there's a whole lot of body of the speaker, that's not being used, or maybe it's Hollow. I don't really know. Maybe it helps with the sound having space in there, but it definitely confused me why it was so much bigger than the actual speaker - and I like compact speakers, so you know no, no, so how do they actually sound? That'S what people want to know it's why they came here to see this review well start from the highs and work our way down to the lows, because that is also the order in which it falls. The highs sound, great they're, very, very crisp. They don't overpower anything they're, not shrilly or tinny or anything, but they sound great, and I definitely like the way songs in a certain genres like certain pop songs and rock songs, guitar acoustic stuff, like that jazz sounds great highs, are excellent. The mids on the goes to companion series too we're medium. I could definitely hear that some mids were especially more prominent in some songs, so they sounded good with again certain songs. It was like hit or miss for me with the mids, and the lows were also decent decent at best. I was into a lot of music like house, music and and music with a lot of bass in it already. So when I'm not hearing it in the Bose and I'm used to hearing it in say my m50 headphones, then it's a little bit weird to not hear that bass. If you listen to a lot of music with intentionally heavy bass, you might not like these as much or you might want to go ahead and pick up a subwoofer for maybe an extra 100 bucks or 75 bucks to really fill in the sound. Because the mids and highs, like I said, are just fine on these speakers other than that yeah, that's basically it. Those are the Bose companion series if you like this review, be sure to give it a thumbs up. It really does help me out and I'll talk to you guys in the next video thanks for watching peace. Oh """
jm3wDComxLQ,Galaxy Nexus Camera Review,4:31,"Hey, what's up guys, it's Marquez from the mkbhd Channel and back with an answer to one of the most frequently asked questions I've gotten about the Galaxy Nexus since I got it and that's been about the camera on the back, it's gotten very mixed reviews. I even gave it a mixed review in my first impressions, video by the way thumbs up on this video um, but I just want to preview this video by saying that you know there are three megapixel sensors. There are five megapixel sensors. There are 8 10 and 12 megapixel sensors all in smartphones, but it's really all about the quality of the optics, which is basically the sensor and the glass and I'll go more into this in the video. But I basically want to let you guys know this is my review of the camera of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus? It'S really all about anything you could possibly want to know about it, so sit back, relax and enjoy. Here we go so, as we've all heard, the Galaxy Nexus has a 5 megapixel rear facing shooter. I like saying shooter instead of camera um, but it has a 5 megapixel shooter and it has a single LED flash, which does a great job for illumination, especially during video. I found that dual LED was actually a little bit too bright. So it's a 5 megapixel back facing shooter and a single LED flash. So let's get right to the test shots cuz! I know that's what you guys, who probably came here to see so we started off indoors, and this is a look at the camera software and one of the most important things about the software is number one captive focus and number 2 instant shutter. So as soon as you take a picture, whether or not it's in focus or not, you can choose whether or not to focus BAM. The pictures taken no lag whatsoever. I'Ll show you some of these pictures and some videos in a second. But basically the gallery is just like any other version of Android, so it's nothing really too noteworthy here. So let's go ahead and jump back out and look at the video mode, video mode with the 5 megapixel sensor. You can take 720p videos or you can take 1080p videos. You can also take standard definition, but I chose for a 720p just so it would match up nicely and the frame rate is 30 frames per second, so you can see here. It does look pretty good. This is all indoors, of course you have a crazy special effects, no one will use and the time-lapse mode and other cool options and stuff. But overall it's about the quality right. Oh yeah yeah, that's right! So, let's just go ahead and start recording and, as you can see here, we are indoors and it doesn't look all that bad but, like I said it's it's from a cell phone, so this is really acceptable. So here's some more video that I took indoors and again not all that bad looking, but not all that sharp either. It could be a little bit sharper. But I do appreciate that I can take a video in low-light, but just remember that in low-light autofocus, like any other camera, will take a little bit longer. So now, let's take it outdoors where this actually really shines. I walked around in 25 degree weather, that's Fahrenheit. I had to get these shots for you and from what I can see it looks around average. You know nothing too spectacular. This is 720p, it definitely works. The frame rate is easily 30 frames per second, so I'm gon na say on the smartphone scale. This guy takes around and eight for me. I definitely would use this to take video and send it to people zooming in and out, though, while recording it's just something you don't want to do. It'S just a tip the front-facing camera on the Galaxy Nexus, which is footage that you're looking at right now is also 720p and it looks pretty good. To be honest, it also has facial tracking. So if I move my head around, it's constantly focused on my face. So that's a pretty good feature and I'm a fan so definitely gon na be using this for, like Google Chat and Skype, and things like that now taking a look at the pictures it takes. These are where it's literally hit or miss. If you press the shutter button, when the item is out of focus, you will get that out of focus picture. So I always tap to focus just to make sure and I got pretty average results again. Nothing to write home about, but the convenience factor of having instant access from the lockscreen and instant shutter really does make up for it. In my opinion, and I'm really a big fan of the camera software rather than the camera hardware, so that's it for you guys, that's basically my overview of the Galaxy Nexus. It'S probably going to be my last video until I can really get to know this phone and give you guys my full review, but expect some other tech videos and some other YouTube tips coming up in the very near future. Thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys later, peace """
CAlNejjtSLc,New Chrome Web Store Review,3:18,"Hey, what's up guys, it's Marquez from the mkbhd YouTube channel back with another HD video of the Chrome Web Store. Now I know you don't have to search through it using Google Voice Search, but I figured I'd show you guys you can do that with chrome. Also anyway, but go ahead and hit the new tab. Page in chrome and you'll also have the option to visit it right here, along with the other app shortcuts. But here is the brand new overview of the Chrome Web Store. It is looking really really good. You can click on the link in the description to check it out yourself up here. You have a preview of all the most popular apps or the featured ones, and if you scroll down, you have all the panes with the the icons. If you will of the less popular apps, but all the rest of the apps that are featured here on the home page, these are all the best of the best applications. So you can see some of these are larger and some of those are smaller thumbnails. Just like in Google, and if you go ahead and hover over one of them, you'll have the option to add it to Chrome, immediately or click on it and use a little pane. Where you can view all the information about the app. So here you can give it a 1 on Google. If you want to add me on Google, that's in the description too, you can add it to Chrome directly if you have screenshots and even view a YouTube video that the company may have chosen to embed, and you can view the details of the app. Of course, they can add all that kind of stuff to their website and all the user reviews. You can leave your review too if you install an application, so that's very helpful, go ahead and exit out of that here. If you see one of the larger panels, you can go directly to the right to view screenshots of that app. So all the featured apps that are have these massive panels here you can view screenshots of them just by clicking the right and left arrows. So that's pretty convenient. Also you notice. My scroll ball is tiny. That'S because you can scroll infinitely through applications, infinite scrolling through as many apps as you want, and eventually, at a certain point it gets to these smaller panes. I think you have to scroll for quite a while, though, here you go so now you have only smaller panes for all the apps, but you still get to go through infinite scroll, which is really convenient. If you just want to waste time in the Chrome Web Store over on the left is, of course, your search and all your categories. This can also there are paid apps here, but you can also get some extensions, so there's extension categories. There'S social and communication. There'S fun: there's news and weather extensions things like that, and once you sort by category it gives you a whole new page again large panes and small panes. So here's a whole bunch of different screen shots of bouncy mouse. You can add it to Chrome immediately or check out these other applications here, I'm gon na go ahead and search for an app I'm gon na search for a weather app. Even though there's a weather category I'll search for weather - and you can see this is what it looks like when you search through apps again, this is, I love the redesigns that Google is putting through all their web apps. It'S really looking good hit the collections button over here and you have a whole bunch of collections of applications. So let's say a money collection, that's a pretty sweet collection of apps right there, Google finance finance 41, a bunch of great apps. I think you guys should check out the Chrome Web Store. It is looking really good and if you enjoyed this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up, I'm gon na. Let you guys go ahead and make sure you have the latest version of Chrome and get to exploring it yourself. So, thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys later peace, you """
LpC6UwZR_Hw,Canon 24mm f/1.4 L Review,4:33,"Hey, what's up guys, it's Marquez from the mkbhd channel back with a video review of the canon. 24 millimeter. F1. Point. 4 lens mark 2. Now let me start off with this. This lens retails for $ 1600. I didn't pay $ 1600 for this lens and it's not for any other legal reasons. I actually cut this lens courtesy of borrow lenses. Calm. You can check out their link in the description. Their service actually allows you to rent the lens. Just like a library book. They'Ll ship it to you and they'll, give you a return shipping label - and you could have this lens for a week for under up to 100 bucks. So if you want to check their service out, that's down below, let's go ahead and take a look at this amazing lens. Now, like I mentioned before, this is the mark 2 version of this lens. There was a mark 1 version, and this mark 2 version actually offers improved image quality. So, as you can see, you're looking at test footage of it right now and it is looking pretty sharp. If I might say myself now, something you need to know about this lens is that it's kind of big and it's a little bit heavy. It actually weighs more than a Canon t2i that I'm filming with itself now this might be nice in terms of balance. The way you're carrying it or the way you hold it when you shoot, but it's good to know that this lens is actually really really big. In fact, it Dwarfs the kit lens that comes with a Canon t2i that 18 to 55 millimeter plastic Kaitlyn's definitely Dwarfs that lens, and this is just a 20 formula, not that it's compensating for anything at all come on well, this lens is good at everything. L lenses should be good at so the barrel is made of a high-quality material. The contacts where it connects with the camera are made of metal, and it has a very, very, very high quality glass inside that, and it also comes with this massive lens hood. I don't know if you knew, but all l lenses actually come with a lenses. So that's pretty convenient. This lens is so gigantic and so wide at 24. Millimeters that the glass inside you can see is actually a little bit curved and in order to get that full frame effect now, distortion has always been an issue for wide-angle lenses, but I found that on my crop sensor t2i. I really don't get any distortion at all now. Auto focus, auto focus on this lens is absurdly good. The ultrasonic motor on all the L lenses are fantastic quality, they're, silent and they're tack, sharp and just about any exposure, and if you do want to do video and do selective manual focusing the focus ring is actually really smooth as well. I was enjoying the feel of the focus ring, especially when doing sort of in cinematic panorama shots and all crazy things, with the focus that I do so that that definitely helped that it was really easy to manipulate. Overall, this lens is really good for a youtuber to rent because number one it's a wide-angle lens. So I can sit here in my room and almost be able to touch the camera, and it appears that it's a pretty wide angle so great for indoors and number two. This is an F 1.4 lens. It lets in a massive amount of light. The iris is absolutely gigantic and high quality glass, so you're gon na be able to get in and dim situations and shoot with still a shallow depth of field. I absolutely love shooting at f 1.4. I reviewed a sigma lens at F 1.4. Not too long ago. You can check that out, and I, like this lens for just the same reason, absolutely excellent wide aperture you can even film like. I am right now with no studio lights. So what would I rate this lens out of 10? Well for image quality? This gets a 9 out of 10 only because it does get a little bit soft at wide angles and on a full frame body. This will be a tiny bit distorted bill. Quality gets a 10 out of 10, so overall, this lens gets a 9 and a half I'd say this is really close to what you'd get for the price. The price you pay, if you pay full price, isn't really worth it, but borrowing this lens you're, definitely gon na be impressed with the quality you get out of it. If you're, looking for more video quality tests of this 24 millimeter, F 1 point 4 L Series lens besides the one you're watching right now, you can also view a pair of link software right here of videos that I've shot with this lens as well. So definitely great quality lens, I can't say quality is I've said this is a great quality lens like 12 times in this video, but you get the point aah-ha thanks for watching this video review, guys and I'll talk to you guys, the next one i'm kb HD Sign now, peace, you """
lF7GLUHu8BE,The Blue Snowball [Review],2:47,"Hey guys welcome to another mkbhd video here we have the blue snowball, which I like to call the snow baller, because it's easily the best USB microphone in this budget. As you might remember, I've said that in a previous video anyway, this video is actually a giveaway video sponsored by blue. So just give this video a thumbs up and leave a comment of the color blue snowball you'd like to win. There are three colors and one random comment: will we pick to win their own blue snowball and their color of choice directly from blue? So if you aren't already familiar with the snowball here's, a basic rundown, it's a plug and play USB microphone designed for those who want affordable, really high quality audio. This will blow just about any built-in microphone in a laptop right out the water around the back of the mic. You can see that you have a switch between three built-in patterns: cardioid, a 10 decibel padded, cardioid and omnidirectional. Now, while people getting this mic might not need all these bells and whistles, it's a great place to start and start learning how these things work. This mic also comes with a pretty sweet. Little plastic tripod stand, that's actually surprisingly, versatile, pretty nimble. I didn't think it would be enough for me, but it actually works just fine on my desk and lets me use it at a number of angles to suit me best, and the mic is also light, light enough that you don't need to buy a better stand To use it, this one will seriously do just fine, so I think you get the point. This mic is definitely worth buying, even if you don't win one from your comment today, especially if you're looking for a professional sounding audio on a tight budget. So what you're? Listening to you right now is unedited audio from the blue snowball right away. This is just straight from the USB microphone plug and play no enhancements whatsoever and, as you can hear, for the price or even for any USB microphone, this sounds really good. So I have no problem with using this for YouTube and you can probably tell why I rated this is one of my highest microphones available for any sort of YouTube video producer, someone who's beginning so, overall, what would I rate this microphone? Well, definitely for sound quality. It could be better, but then again this is better than most other USB microphones, so I'm gon na go ahead and give this a 7 out of 10 for audio quality. Both construction, like I mentioned in the video, is mostly plastic, but it's fantastic plastic. There'S no problems with it: seven and a half out of ten and for ease of use this. This is hands-down one of the easiest microphones to use 10 out of 10 wonderful job from blue there and overall I give this microphone and eight or an eight and a half. This is a great mic for beginners on YouTube and again, if you want to win one make sure you leave a thumbs up on this video and leave a comment of one of the three colors available that you can win directly from blue. That'S basically it guys, thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace you """
8W3bJGflOic,The DROID [Retro Review],4:22,"Hey guys, it's mkbhd welcome back to another HD video. Now, if I've ever gotten close to doing a retro review video, this is probably the closest I've ever gotten to doing one, and if this video does get 800 likes I'll, actually be giving one away you're. Looking at the review of the phone that started it all the revolutionary device, the one that Android fans like me, really identified themselves by when Android first gained that identity and that's the original Motorola Droid. You can watch my original review by clicking the Cheerios and again, like I said, if you liked the video and unlocked Motorola Droid will be given away so giveaway details are always on Twitter without any further ado. Let'S go ahead and take it to the granddaddy of the all devices that I think are making their way up on the Verizon platform right now, let's go ahead and check out the original Motorola Droid if you've been an mkbhd viewer for long enough, you've watched my Original Motorola Droid review two years ago back at the end of 2009, and this was the biggest baddest new Android phone out there. And if you didn't already know this has been my on contract phone ever since then. I take really good care of my gadgets and my phone is no exception. So, while this does look beat up keep in mind, this is two years of usage. That'S gone into this device. That being said, one of the best parts of the Droid is that it is all metal. This phone has been dropped, opened and closed. Hundreds of times slid across surfaces and you know had more than its share of beating up and it's more than held itself together. Without a single replacement battery life, as we can expect, has degraded slightly, but that's not stopping me from getting a full day of use out of it. You'Ll see a bit of my secret for battery life at the end of this video, but overall it hasn't been the least bit disappointing to a person who uses their phone really often like I do and as you know, the Droid is a slider. I'Ve been holding out for the Nexus Prime, which won't have a keyboard, but I occasionally use the crap out of this keyboard for long messages and emails and stuff, and I'm as you can see, I'm pretty good with it too. This keyboard started off really flat and two years later it feels even flatter. Just like a touchscreen, I'm sure oh gee, droid users are definitely ready to make the transaction with me to an all touchscreen phone and again that should probably be the Nexus Prime. But overall everything else about the Droid is still it's fat, grandpa self. It has that rugged, rubberized feel in the hand and feels good, no matter really what orientation you use it in now. I promise to show you the software mods I'm using to make this my daily driver. So let's go ahead and take a look at that. First of all, I'm using a custom ROM - and this is the simply stunning gingerbread ROM and it's running on an ultra-low voltage. 1.25 gigahertz kernel. Yes, that's 1.25 gigahertz on it's single core. I use an app called set CPU to manage that keep the timings just right and when the droid screen is off, it actually under clocks way down to just 125 megahertz saving a ton of battery life and another question I get about the droid. A lot is: is it slow? Well not at one point two: five gigahertz, it's not, but I'm using a home screen replacement, called launcher Pro Plus and as I'm about to show you here, this ROM is based off of the latest version of Android 2.3.4. So this phone is actually liquid fast, so here's the ROM info and the OS version and everything and you can see it - flies through the menus, as you'd expect from a 1.25 gigahertz processor speed. The one reason it still feels like an OG droid is the ram it doesn't have nearly as much RAM as the other zippy phones out there. So apps don't stay loaded in memory as long and now don't get me wrong. Some apps still are quick to open but, as you can see here, typically it's up to the processor to do the work and just like the rest of my desk setup and office setup here in my dorm room, I have relatively minimalist style. So I keep the applications I use and need, and only the applications I use in need nothing, no extra parts in this machine. This is how you keep a phone running, smooth and fast for a long long time. So there you have it. It'S been 2 years with the Motorola, Droid and you've just finished watching my first retro review. Video leave a thumbs up for a chance to win, and let me know what do you think of my droid setup either way thanks for watching and be sure to subscribe.

Krdb8lceRoI,Audio Technica ATH-M50 [Review],3:37,"Hey guys, it's mkbhd back with an HD video review of the audio technica ath em 50s, my self-proclaimed best headphones for under 200 bucks period. So you know these have to be good, and if this video gets 800 likes, I will give away a pair on Twitter. So you can view that link below so let's get started so right away. You can see the m50 sr a sleek high-quality pair of headphones and they feature a really solid, build of mostly metal and a little bit of plastic. But for the price point like I said, if you're looking for sub $ 200 headphones in terms of build quality, this is absolutely the way to go so starting from the bottom and working our way up. We have a three-and-a-half millimeter gold-plated headphone jack, with a really really solid, build, don't see that breaking anytime soon connected to this jack is a 1.2 meter or 4 foot cable and that cable is also coiled. So that makes it more like 6 feet. So you can reach it around behind a desk or something over at the other end of the cable. It'S the star of the show. It'S the m50 s themselves, looking good so starting off with a build quality. These headphones are top notch, which is an awesome segue, because these have little notches on the sides that allow you to adjust the size of the headphones. So that's perfect: if you have a gigantic dome, you can still rock these or if you have a tiny skull. These will work for you too also, you can see these are adjustable in all kinds of ways, so you can literally have a pterodactyl shaped head, and these will still create a seal. Wonderful, oh and, unlike some other headphones in this budget, this pair is ridiculously durable. So major props to Audio Technica on this one well done, and another thing I like to talk about in headphones is comfort, and this is one of the again top of the line for this budget. It'S really really soft and all the parts are flexible enough to fit to your pterodactyl size door or whatever sized head, and yet they do all this, while still being able to fold up and fit in this handy dandy, carrying pouch thing. But what's a headphone review without word on how they sound well they'll, be pretty stupid, so we're going to check that out right now. First, we have to get some music on there. We go perfect, let's listen to some Gaga! First, all right! So I'm just gon na tell you right now. These headphones are flat-out, amazing pun intended that was that was intended. The frequency response is flat and amazingly accurate. I would happily pay two hundred two hundred fifty dollars for these headphones, but, as you can see by the link in the description, I only paid one hundred and sixty, even if you have the most crazy musical tastes any of the music I'm listening to right now Sounds amazing: the lows are very, very deep: they're, not overpowering at all. The mids are very well balanced and the highs are extremely nice. They sound just as fine with the mids and the lows as any other hives. I'Ve ever heard. So this is one well balanced pair of headphones and I couldn't recommend anything else. If you have a two hundred dollar budget, this is the pair of headphones. You need to buy. This is also going to earn this. I think the third ever mkbhd ten out of ten product rating, so you believe me if you, if you have any problems with these headphones, come to me and by the way, if this video does get you hundred ratings, I do want to see a video review From the person that wins them either way, thanks for watching this, video mkbhd signing out peace, """
G4E2bbAgjXg,Galaxy Z Fold 2 Review: Folding King... But For What?,10:45,"The year is 2020, it's september. I just want to be the one to point out. This is the third folding phone in a row getting a video what a time to be alive what's up mkbhd here - and this is a samsung galaxy z, fold. 2. 5G. The fold 2 brought to you by optical flow, of course, and this is the only phone that folds - that i can actually recommend. Any group of people actually buy in 2020.. It'S still expensive, it's 2 000 bucks and it's still got its compromises. The tech inside is still very young, but this is the best one. This is the king, but for every reason out there that this is the king of folding phones, there's. Another reason why you probably still shouldn't buy one yet a big part of why the fold 2 is so good, is the hardware this generation 2.5 hardware here is the most evolved, so this build even makes the previous galaxy folds look a little sloppy like it's boxier. It'S more squared off, it's tighter, the hinge is firmer and i still i love this satin finish and the brushed metal look. Of course, it is truly samsung improving in a ton of places at once, but also fundamentally, it's still a kind of awkward galaxy fold form factor that we're used to there's still a gap between the screens when it's closed and it is still pretty thick. It'S still a chunky, candy bar phone when it's closed, which is a little awkward to hold and definitely a solid chunk in your pocket. So it's a little give a little take, but i think obviously, the biggest change you'll notice, the most impressive thing you will instantly recognize is the new screens both on the inside and outside. They are, technically speaking, a massive improvement. They are spec for spec everything. You would have wanted them to improve, but in use these actually also turn out to be kind of a win-lose. So on the outside of course, way. Bigger full screen corner to corner 6.2 inch cover display way better, looking way, more modern, just a hole, punch, selfie camera up top. Clearly, this is an improvement. It'S what we were all thinking when we saw the first fold when are they gon na fill up that screen and now they did, but the funny thing is okay, part of the dynamic of having that tiny cover screen on the old fold. I talked about this in the review. Is it's actually a barrier to entry to getting lost in your phone? So if you just need to do something real, quick, like you get a text, you want to reply or just change the song in spotify or just something real, quick in the notifications. You do that on the tiny cover screen and then you turn it off and you're done, because you don't want to use the tiny screen very much. But if you really do need to get something done, then, okay, you got a galaxy fold, you open it up and you use the main screen. But now that outside screen is so big you can actually use it more often and it's not so bad. You can kind of just use that outside like a normal smartphone, it is a little narrow, so typing is still kind of compressed and the aspect ratio is a bit odd, sometimes with some apps, but actually found myself, one-handed scrolling through twitter or instagram or relay for Reddit or just kind of burning time on the outside screen in a way i never would have on the tiny front screen before and now. Reachability is actually more of a problem, because the screen is so tall now that it can be kind of hard to reach. The top one-handed, so weirdly, what's happening, is getting this way. Bigger better outside screen made me more comfortable just staying on the outside screen, just hanging out on the outside, like a normal phone, which is a terrible habit to get into, because clearly the inside screen is amazing. This is where all the magic happens. The main display here on the fold 2 is pretty much all win, and this is what makes the galaxy fold so fun to use and such a king, really it's bigger, it's brighter bezels are smaller, notches have disappeared and it's now bumped up to 120 hertz. It'S such a win that you know that you can carry around a screen like this in your pocket at all is awesome every time i unfold it. I just kind of want to find something to do so. I can keep using it. It'S so great. The sad thing is the software experience, mostly, the app optimization is still catching up to this odd aspect ratio, since it basically is a mini tablet, and there is also now a setting in the fold too that lets you use tablet mode with some apps that support It instead of just big blown up phone mode, so there's columns and everything now, but a lot of apps still have trouble. Looking good on this squarish aspect ratio, videos hardly ever fill it up unless you're watching a brandon, havard video, maybe there's also always huge black bars instagram and a lot of other apps are just kind of weird blown up phone versions. Even the camera viewfinder isn't quite filling up the whole display and that can kind of cheapen the experience, but every once in a while. There are some good apps, where you turn it 90 degrees and you're in that columns, mode and tablet mode like spotify or gmail, and this thing becomes so great. It'S a productivity machine. I was loving that i think a world where all my favorite apps have a version like that to take advantage of this display is going to be awesome. It'S just that's not quite the world. The galaxy fold lives in yet, and i also found something quite interesting with the battery. So in making the fold my daily driver, i was a little bit concerned. I was going to pay attention to the battery right. It'S a bigger outside screen, a bigger and 120 hertz inside screen and the battery's not seeing a huge bump up. So i'm going to pay attention to battery right. So i'm testing the phone i'm using it like every day and i'm starting to notice. I'M getting to the end of days with more battery than i did on the old fold, like i'm ending days with, like 35 45 left, and i was thinking about it and it turns out it's not because of some crazy optimization. It'S not the new specs. It'S not some bigger internal battery or some hack. It was because i'm i'm using this smaller 60 hertz display so much more than i was on the old fold that i was actually saving battery that way. So this is just a weird usage habit that i picked up. Of course, your mileage may vary. I think there's going to be people that get this phone and like never ever want to use the outside candy bar display, and i totally get it it's. It'S kind of jarring, actually going back and forth between 60 hertz and 120 hertz and such a weird aspect ratio, but i'm just telling you how it ended up for me battery was improved because i was using the outside display more than i expected to so when You put it all together: galaxy z, fold. 2. Right now is the folding phone king. It'S the best folding phone in a lot of ways like it's got the best specs of any foldable, that's for sure, snapdragon, 865 plus 12 gigs of ram. It'S the only one. I think, with wireless charging other than the z-flip, it's got the best set of cameras in any foldable coming in pretty much around the same tier as galaxy s20. It doesn't have all the the super highest end features like space, zoom or 8k video, but it'll still do 10x zoom and it is still a triple camera with a main, a telephoto and an ultra wide that you can also use as your selfie camera. Thanks to a software feature, so you're going to deliver photos that are still very clearly very easily samsung flagship photos with all their hdr and bright and vibrant look, which is great. It'S got some of the best battery of any foldable, even minus. My anecdote of using the outside screen more, it's still packing a 4 500 milliamp hour dual battery and that's been more than enough for regular use and it's got the best screens of any foldable. And maybe this is debatable, but it's easily the best brightness colors and resolution an amazing, thin bezel, 2k 120 hertz amoled inside it's just so sick that you can get this in your pocket. It even has the best fingerprint reader from my experience right on the power button. It'S got the best speakers, i've heard in a foldable for sure, and one of the best hinges now that they've tightened it up and given it a more confident feeling firmer hinge that can stay in place at multiple angles, plus a couple software tricks to take advantage Of it like special modes with youtube and the camera app, if you can remember to use them they're kind of cool, so thanks to samsung having the most iterations to work on this i'd say this is like 2.5. This is the king right now in 2020.. For what, though, like what does it mean to be the best thing in a category that most people should still avoid in 2020? Right now like? If this is the best we can do, and this is the best screen in a foldable. But you still have a pretty pronounced crease that the eye can still catch from various angles. It'S the king, but for what? If this is the best, we can do with ultra thin glass, but there's still a factory installed screen protector with the edges. All the way around it that samsung tells people not to remove themselves, but it's still going to collect dust around the camera cut out where you can clearly see they took a shortcut, it's it's the king, but for what? If this is the best, we can do with a confident well-engineered hinge that hopefully doesn't have any durability issues in the future and lets you feel like you have the most control over the phone and the software layer on top of android does as much as it Can to help continuity between the outside screen and the inside screen, but still 75 percent of apps look like a stretched, awkward version of themselves. Every time you open them up, it's the king, but for what so, even though this is the best folding phone, it's also still super obvious that this is nowhere near the end of the line. It'S nowhere near mature. Yet, first of all, there's still compromises like the outside screen is still slightly worse than a normal smartphone, because it's it's suit tall and narrow and chunky to hold. And then the inside screen is also still slightly worse than a normal tablet, because it's a little smaller and it's a little squarer and it has a crease and number two. It'S still expensive. It'S 2 000 bucks for that price. It'S always crazy to make comparisons, but you could get an ipad pro and a pixel 4a and some sony noise cancelling headphones and probably have money left over. But there's something you get with the galaxy fold too, that you don't really get anywhere else, which is the most complete most evolved, foldable phone so far that you can actually get and having all that stuff in one device that you can fit in your pocket. That'S a pretty sweet start thanks for watching catch. You guys in the next one peace. """
0fB2cQFp008,"Surface Duo Review: The Good, The Bad & The Ugly!",14:44,"Hey what's up mkbhd here, and this is the surface duo screen on in all of its super sweet hinge, well-built ultra thin glory. It'S an amazing piece of hardware, but actually using it, as i have been for the past two to three weeks is a bit of a mixed bag, so i'm just gon na come right off the top and say it. I don't think most people should buy this and that's fine. I think, there's a lot of pretty cool devices out there that just aren't right for most people to buy and use. That'S all right, but now that you know that right off the top of the review, i want to approach this a little bit of a different way, a little more conceptual and just highlight the good, the bad and the ugly which actually for for surface duo. I'M gon na adjust a little it'll, be the good, the meh and the bad, because there are some really good pieces and some really good ideas. Then there's some meh stuff that didn't really quite work out and then there's some really bad too. But the most interesting thing is almost all of this comes from it being a first generation device. This is the first surface duo. It'S the first foldable phone from microsoft. It'S the first android phone from microsoft. It'S the first dual screen pocketable device with no cover screen. Like this, the first razer thin phone with a 360 degree hinge and two five-inch displays like this. So it's the first at a lot of things. But the thing is it's, the second generation of most things, that's the most interesting, or at least the most telling like that's when you get to see all of the learnings about what went well and what didn't go well and what they can change versus what they Can'T that's what's exciting. I am literally already looking forward to surface duo 2 like a lot, but let me just show you what went well and what didn't with this one, [ Applause ]! So what's the good? Well, if you remember the the first impressions video, where nobody was allowed to turn it on uh, i was raving about that hardware and that hinge - and i am sticking by that - the crazy thinness is obviously the first thing that strikes you. It'S barely thicker than a usb-c port on each side and then the 360-degree hinge. It'S awesome. It has this smoothness, but also a firmness to it where it can stop in any position. That'S just awesome so props to the hinge engineers and the result is all these postures, these different modes that you can hold or prop up the device. There'S book mode horizontal with you know, one screen on each side kind of like a book like this. There is compose mode so keyboard on one screen: content on the other single screen mode, thanks to the hinge flip, it all the way around 360 degrees pick a screen, there's also tent mode and peak mode and right as you get into all these postures, things do Get pretty complex because now the device is responding to a variety of orientation, changes and state of fold changes and we'll get more into the bugs, of course later in this video, but when it works well, it's really cool. It'S really nice. You can open up an app on one screen and literally do anything you want on the other screen. You can read two things at once. You can watch a video on one screen and take notes on it. On the other screen. You can move the video to the other side and move the notes back to the other side. You can just mess around you. Can you can close something and multitask while the video keeps going, you can always switch? What screen something is on or even drag to. The middle and span it between two screens now not every app, looks good spanned across both screens matter of fact, most don't like right now, it's up to developers to get in and update their apps and take advantage of this multitasking experience, which may not happen very Quickly, depending on how popular this is, but if you look at microsoft, suite of apps, the 365 suite outlook is a really good example where you span it across and you get email on one side and you can. You can use your calendar and view single events on one side and the calendar on the other, it's great so for me and surface duo, i found i tend to start by opening it up in book mode and then i slowly get into whatever i'm doing, which Is usually just on one side and then it's kind of awkward having the other side just kind of staring at me with nothing happening, wasting power, so i often switch over to single screen mode and use it like that and that's cool. It keeps the volume rocker and the power button on the right hand, side it's not bad. Basically, it's just a little wider than normal for typing, which i will again get to in a bit, but hey, there's always compose mode for when i need to do some really extended typing, like crafting a beautiful tweet with no typos or you know, writing an email Really the best example of this and microsoft knows: multitasking is a huge upside for surface duo, but samsung. Does it too on the fold? Is the app pairs, so they call them app groups and you can launch two apps at the same time, two different apps and you can come up with all sorts of sweet, combos and great ideas for how to use these. All you got ta do to make one of your own is pick an app hold. It down. Select app group pick the second app to pair them together then pick which screen you want each one to be on then create it, and just like that, i'm feeling, like an absolute productivity machine, pulling out the surface duo, flipping it open, launching a calendar in the Email at the same time - and yes, that's easily my most common app group - it's just so good - it makes so much sense with the dual screens, typically when you're multitasking on a phone. If you even do this at all you're like dragging two different windows, around sort of abstractly and even on the fold, you can do three at once, but how many people are really doing that with this? It'S just kind of staring you in the face like you have to you have to multitask. So that's what it does well really. Well, that's the core of what makes it a surface. So now, let's get into this stuff that is uh meh, so the bezels, a lot of people out here are really not feeling it. I definitely wish they were thinner, but you also have to realize the side. Bezels uh are actually a measure against accidental touches. That'S about as thin as you could get them without starting to touch the screen all the time, but i just think the top and bottom bezels are a little thick, then pocketability. So, okay, it is two 5.6 inch displays, but, as you can tell they're very wide for if it was a normal 5.6 inch phone plus those bezels, so the whole thing is shaped like a passport that you might be more likely to put in a back pocket. So for me it does stick out a bit in the front pocket i've kind of gotten used to it uh. But at this point, there's there's some big phones out there and this one sticks out, above all the rest as a little bit tough on smaller pockets. Maybe a little bit narrower would have been more palatable and then typing overall yeah. It'S it's all right, like it's a it's a mixed bag like i said so, the compose mode where you're just typing on the bottom screen, and you have whatever content on the top screen. That'S fine and microsoft. They partnered with swiftkey on this keyboard for android. That sort of smartly adapts to whatever posture you're in and shifts the keyboard accordingly. So if you're in book mode, you can't really type with one hand all over that one side screen. So if you need to it shifts the keyboard over and on one side, you can reach all the keys. It'S still way slower than two thumb typing, but it's better than nothing. The only bummer here is uh. Other third party keyboards - don't have this optimization yet so my keyboard of choice is g board and it just looks silly trying to span across the whole thing. So typing was hit or miss got ta, use, swiftkey and then performance. It'S you know, look we knew it wasn't gon na be the best performer. It was in development for a whole year, so it has last year's specs, snapdragon 855 and six gigs of ram it's not going to benchmark the highest. We knew that, but i think just using it, you start to see performance issues and i think my biggest performance issue here was just overall fluidity at 60, hertz and sure that's partially, because i am coming from other smooth high refresh rate flagships, including the new galaxy Fold actually, but i'm also just noticing a ton of little hiccups and lags while just moving around and multitasking. I think this device, that's geared specifically for multitaskers, could have hit us with a little bit more than six gigs of ram like. If it was me, i would have wanted like 12 gigs of ram in this guy, but yeah if you're used to flagship performance or any other high-end performance from an expensive phone, you kind of get it here, but overall meh and then battery life is also. You know kind of middle of the road better than i thought it would be. Actually so standby time is pretty good. It'S a 3600 milliamp hour battery, so i find when i'm opening it and using it like two screen multitasking. I can start to bleed through battery pretty fast and i can kill it in a day now, when i'm switching to one screen mode, which i did more often than not, which by the way is kind of rough with some car gps's like if you try to Put it in your dashboard, it's kind of silly, but either way when i'm using it one screen, i'm not drawing power from the back screen as much so i'm actually getting better battery life. When i do that and right now, i'm at half battery at 1 30 pm it's acceptable. But again you know you don't have wireless charging. You only have 18 watt fast charging, so overall the battery meh, but then we get to the bad like the stuff that it's truly terrible at, and i don't throw that word around very often. But it's when you get this first gen stuff, sometimes you're just gon na not have things go well right and so i'll even try to explore a little bit. Why i think some of these things went so bad. So, first of all the speaker, the speaker is absolute trash and i think it's pretty simple, there's just not enough room in here for some great speakers like it's a thin body, they're, not really top or bottom mounted, like you might expect to find them. It'S uh. Just at the top here in the earpiece and the slot up there, that's it so at absolute maximum volume, it sounds like a normal smartphone speaker at 50 volume and inside a tin can like it's pretty brutal, not enough room for a good speaker here and then The camera, so the camera is in fact terrible. The quality is trash and we kind of knew it would be already because it's like the opposite of what the zenfone is doing so on the zenfone 7, the huge main camera swivels around and becomes like basically the world's best selfie camera. On the surface duo you swivel around the selfie camera and it becomes possibly the worst main camera you can have at least the worst i've seen in a 1400 phone anyway - and you know, microsoft does call it an adaptive 11 megapixel camera. So it can tell when it's taking a selfie and optimized for faces versus when it's taking a regular photo but yeah all the optimization in the world isn't going to save this you're not going to make a webcam feel like a big optically stabilized sensor. It'S just not going to take good photos, but look it's not just the quality of the photos, this bad. It'S also just the ergonomics of taking a photo there's, no back camera like we've established so every time i want to take a photo of something in front of me. I have to do this flip it around unlock it open the camera app and then it's going to be in selfie mode. So now i have to try to swivel it around and get it to flip and by the time, i'm doing all this half the time. The shot is gone or i don't even feel like taking a photo anymore. So it felt like it actively discouraged me from taking photos and videos and really the worst bug is trying to get it to switch to the front viewfinder you're supposed to be able to double tap, to get it to switch. But it still stays in that selfie mode so often and pretty much anywhere else in the ui. You can force it to switch screens at any time by double tapping the off screen and it usually works great. But i guess in the camera, it's not listening to the double tap and the accelerometer is difficult to get it to switch it's rough and then there's a there's, a flash up there in the in the top bezel. Just to what. Why is there a flash? Is anyone really using this for nighttime photography but look microsoft? They know their audience right. This is the same company that has the the biggest most advertised feature of their new ear. Pods is the ability to swipe through powerpoint, slides, like the surface duo? Buyer doesn't really take a ton of photos and videos and stuff it's not a big deal. This will be fine for the occasional video chat. You know scanning documents, maybe a selfie once in a while, but i think the point is just leaving it at that is sacrificing what most people would want, which is like a a nice set of cameras on the back for what they've already decided they want, which Is a nice thin device with a 360 hinge that folds flat and i think that's gon na hold it back. I mean don't get me wrong. I still raved about how thin it was in the hardware and how much i love it, and i like that. I could get creative and prop it up in tent mode and get videos of myself without needing anyone's help, even though the videos were garbagio quality that was kind of cool. But the theme that i'm getting at here is overall practicality suffering at the expense of folding. It in half is the thing that's holding back all: first generation, folding phones, it's the challenge for all of them, and it's definitely happening here with surface duo. This phone has no wireless charging, no ip rating, no real ecosystem around it very little app support out of the gate and even a lot of the little things you might hope for in a phone of this price, no 5g, no headphone jack, no high refresh rate. No super fast wireless charging, not great haptics. You know. Practicality is clearly suffering to achieve this form factor, but in future generations, when this actually improves and they're able to add back those things. That'S when foldables will actually have a convincing future when it's not like you're, sacrificing and sacrificing, but you happen to get it to fold now when the fold is just another feature, that'll be a sweet future. That'S the day! That'S that's what i'm looking forward to. So you know you do file this first, one in do not buy but keep an eye on it, because i really think they're on to something i like the dual screen thing. It'S the same reason i sit in front of dual screen monitors at my desk. Instead of an ultrawide, it's because the productivity, the staying in your flow, the compartmentalization of having two screens, it works, it's real, and so i'm looking forward to the next surface duo and that's the review of the first one thanks for watching catch, you guys the next One peace """
R94ntpWVelw,Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Review: It Better Be Good!,13:33,"What'S up mkvhd here, so i was talking to a friend recently and he asked me what phone i was using and it was the galaxy note. 20 ultra sitting right in front of me, and so i said, oh nice cool. So how do you like it? And this is the moment where i have to try to distill all of my thoughts and my testing and my experience into like one sentence. That'S easily digestible to a you know a regular everyday person, that's not in the tech world and what came out of my mouth was yeah. It is it's really nice, but it's also 1 300, so it better be, and so, when i step back to really think about it and to put together all my thoughts for this full review for you guys that thought really just kept coming back to me over And over because at this price you really only see like the crazy first gen experimental, folding phones or flagships, the bleeding edge absolute best that a company has to offer, and this this is a 1300 flagship. So it's got to be top of the line at basically everything to even consider it worth buying and the note 20 ultra for me kind of lives up to that. First of all, this is the best looking best built phone samsung has ever made. In my opinion, the matte sort of soft touch finish on the back: the boxy flat top and bottom, the razor thin bezels, the chamfers at all the metal rails and edges. Even this color, this mystic bronze, is not normally a look. I go for it's kinda, pink from some angles, but also kinda rose gold from some other angles, but actually kind of like it, and i like the contrast with the dark camera bump. So all the way around, like i said from the first time i picked up this metal and glass phone in my first impressions, video it screams quality and with samsung's flagships, there's always also a bunch of the little things that also add up to make that premium. Feeling experience things that we would be nitpicking and complaining about if they weren't here for this price, but they are here so the vibration motor is really high quality. The same ultrasonic in display fingerprint reader is back here and it's pretty fast. There'S wireless charging. That'S here, reverse wireless charging is here: there's ip68 water resistance, all the stuff we kind of take for granted to be in a samsung flagship, but it is all here again just no headphone jack and then i think the two main things that make this an ultra Note are the display and the s pen, so the display at the risk of sounding like displaymate, is a plus plus, but it is an awesome screen. It'S a 6.9 inch, quad hd super amoled display. It'S got hdr certification, the 120 hertz refresh rate the tiny hole punch in the top of the middle outstanding maximum and minimum brightness. It'S crispy. It'S great. I mean it's just a great screen, but there are believe it or not. Both pros and cons to this ultra screen the main con being. It is absolutely massive and it has curved edges. And yes, i did experience accidental touches occasionally, and i think that happened more often thanks to the hand gymnastics that are required to handle such a big screen like this i've said it before and i'll say it again, i'm on the side of preferring we go back To flat displays, but this one is not flat, but also, of course, having a huge display that goes right up to the edges and a tiny hole punch cutout i mean that makes a pretty solid media experience, although i will say maybe my only hardware disappointment in This phone is the speaker system, not that it's problematic. It'S not bad at all. It'S just easy to block that bottom speaker and it is a stereo pair with the earpiece. But overall, despite its dolby ammo support, i was unimpressed with the actual quality or fullness of the sound from the speakers. The specs behind the display are all high-end, as you'd expect, if you didn't already know, snapdragon 865 plus, and this unit has 12 gigs of ram. Now you know, and that combined with the 120 hertz display, is really everything i want in a smartphone nowadays, you've heard me talk about high refresh rate. It makes its way to yet another flagship here. In the note - and yes, i still love it, there were no problems with performance and smoothness from my usage was great. Also behind the notes display is the same ultrasonic fingerprint reader. We saw in the s20 ultra and it's ultra impressive and ultra similar to last year's performance, nothing ultra special here and then you got yourself a 4 500 milliamp hour battery. Now, i'm old enough to remember when samsung galaxy note was like the the big battery phone. It was a battery champ, it was the phone that us nerds would take to ces because it was just the battery you couldn't kill in one day. It'S not that anymore. You know shocker, you can kill this 4 500 milliamp hour battery with a giant 120 hertz display using it all the time you can kill it, even if it's not a quad hd, but with typical use. Note 20 ultra's battery is good, like it's six hours of screen on time, ending a day with 15 to 25 battery left regularly good, and i have no problems with that, especially when this phone also supports 45 watt fast charging and there's wireless charging. So it's good. If you really want the extra next level battery champ, there are other phones, including the brother of this phone s20 ultra, which is kind of just like the same form. Factor minus the s pen, that's a 5 000 milliamp hour battery. So that's better, but this is good. Okay, let's talk about the camera, i have a lot to say about this camera system, as you can probably imagine, but i'll try to keep it concise here. First of all, this camera bump is huge. It'S huge - and there are other phones with big camera bumps big camera systems, but something about this one just being a straight up shelf like it's not tiered, like the s20 ultra or rounded, or you know, a double shelf like some others, they don't try to hide It it's just a big block on the back of this phone that sticks out so much that it actually has a tendency to gather dust in the corners around it. But i honestly don't hate it. It'S like they're owning it. It'S a character, piece that you know. Maybe has time to grow on you the rings around. The three cameras to me, i think, is a good look and you do get a great array of cameras. It'S the 108 megapixel standard camera that sort of rattles a bit when you shake it, because it's so big and then there's a 12 megapixel ultra wide and a 12 megapixel periscope zoom camera. If you really do hate the camera bump and the fact that it sticks out so much and wobbles like crazy, when it's on a desk, you can always grab a grip case from channel sponsor dbrand. It'S actually literally the perfect size to get rid of the camera bump, and then you got your added protection, so i'll drop a link below if you're interested in that, if not, you can live dangerously like me and walk around with a glass phone and no protection. So how are the cameras? They are great. First of all, the addition of the laser autofocus really fixed the hunting problems. The galaxy s20 ultra was having, with this same huge camera module. Now it's not the same tracking autofocus as a pixel, but the hunting is gone. Close-Up subjects are no longer problematic, but what it didn't fix is the shutter lag. So there's still a pretty noticeable delay between tapping to take a photo and when the actual capture happens, which is kind of a bummer. If you're trying to capture fast motion or any action type stuff or just like trying to time a photo of a fire truck outside a hotel at 3am to not be flaring into the lens. But i will say that, with the caveat that you got to be a little more patient and hold the camera still and wait for the shutter lag, this camera turns out outstanding photos in all kinds of conditions in daylight in harsh shooting into the sun shooting at Night shooting indoors and outdoors this thing crushes. I think you could make an argument that it's just above the pixel for versatility, thanks to having a really good ultra wide. That'S almost as sharp as the main lens and, of course, the massive zoom capabilities that you never have to use, but if you do they're impressive, still, 50x isn't as insane as 100x, but it's far more than you'll probably ever need. And so you can rest easy that anytime, you need a quick, 4x or 8x zoom. The photo will still be plenty sharp. The 10 megapixel selfie camera is fairly average but acceptable and then for video i'd, put it again right below the iphone system. Thanks to the super, steady mode and all the 8k options and the faster autofocus, but really i was having most of my fun with the main sensor and taking photos that i think, would often rival what you take from any other phone iphone. 11 pro pixel 4 huawei phones. This is right up there well done samsung on these cameras just makes it feel like the gigantic camera bump is more worth it. Are you impressed that we got this far into a galaxy note review without talking about the s pen? Yet so the s pen got some pretty dramatic technical improvements in the note 20 ultra this year, mainly that the latency is now down all the way to nine milliseconds on this better display, and that translates to apple pencil levels of realism and responsiveness. You love to see it. You love to hear it also. Maybe there's this sound now, when you write with the s pen that actually corresponds pretty well with how it would sound if you were writing on like a chalkboard or a pen on paper or something it's. It'S pretty impressive, but i could also see that getting annoying to someone who uses the s pen like a lot, so you can turn that off but yeah. Technically speaking, it is a big improvement, but the s pen really overall, is the same thing. It'S been for a while, which, depending on who you are, is either a fun optional accessory that comes along with this flagship or an absolutely vital tool for sketching or note-taking or annotation work. You may remember from my previous reviews: i'm not the biggest s pen person. So, for someone like me, a galaxy note, probably isn't the best use of money, but there are people who every year wait for the latest galaxy note, because this phone represents the absolute best stylist experience on a phone and so for those people yeah. This is it. I could make this like a an hour and a half long video. If i tried to cover all of the features buried in samsung's software, because they absolutely pack this phone to the gills, the edge lighting, the secure folder, the wireless music sharing, the air actions, the reverse wireless charging, the wireless decks is super impressive, even bixby bixby. I mean i found, there's always something buried in here that you've either never heard about, or maybe you knew about it, but just didn't use it, because samsung airs on the side of shoving in too many features, instead of the other way around like trying to keep It super simple and leaving things out that aren't perfect. It'S like the opposite of the apple strategy, and you see that throughout using this phone from the launcher to the camera app to the settings and if there's any upside to that, it certainly makes you feel like you're more getting your money's worth. But at the end of the day, are you are you getting 1 300 worth of smartphone here? Honestly, that's probably pushing it. I'D say you probably aren't, but the thing about samsung launch prices is they're guaranteed to fall like this phone in three or four months. Will most likely cost a bit less than it does now at launch? But if there's any phone that makes it feel like you're, getting the absolute complete package from the spec sheet to the huge incredible display to the build quality to the cameras to the battery. To the stylus, you can't get anywhere else to the software. It'S probably this one, but i want to end it all with this. What is a review really? Well, it's given your opinion on something you've used, try to figure out if what you're buying is worth it or not, right and so samsung sent us all reviewers. This galaxy note, 20 ultra, which is really really great phone for 300 bucks and so we're all out. Since we have it early, we're all testing and enthusiastically giving this phone a shot, but none of us, as far as i know, have the note 20, which is the thousand dollar plastic. 1080P 60 hertz, in my opinion, severely overpriced phone. None of us are out enthusiastically testing and reviewing that one psa, that's probably on purpose. So note, 20 ultra is 1300 bucks. If you can swing it great. If you're looking for something similar but looking to save a bit of money, i would actually hold off on trying to just go straight to the note 20. For now, i would wait for some reviews of that at least or maybe look to some other phones. Some other galaxy, s20 plus or even some non-samsung phones, because - and this is a new thought to have now in 2020 - just attaching the note name to something doesn't necessarily mean flagship quality anymore, like it used to becca from the verge made a really great point in Her video about samsung's lineup, which is the word you used to look for to symbolize and describe the absolute best in samsung's lineup, used to be note, but it's not now. The word you need to look for is ultra the ultra. It'S a nice phone yeah, but for 300 bucks it better. Be that's been it thanks for watching catch, you guys, the next one. Peace """
bInJjmH31Hk,Sony WH-1000XM4 Review: The Final Form!,7:38,"What'S up mkbhd here, sony wh-1000xm4: these are those and you couldn't tell just by looking at them, because they look almost identical to the mark iii's from the last generation, but that's totally fine, because no one really had any major complaints with the mark iii's. At least i didn't, i crowned them, my active noise cancellation kings, but now here they are, these are the mark fours. They are the same price 349 and sony smartly took the. If it ain't broke, don't fix it approach and basically just addressed all the small little requests that people like me had with the last generation. It'S like they lined up all their little nitpicks and knocked them all down. So, okay, what was left to improve? Well number. One my biggest request was multiple device support and it took them two years, but they finally did it and they've added multiple device support to the mark iv. So the ability to pair these headphones actively to more than one device at once. It might sound like kind of a niche thing, but it's such a big deal. If you have your headphones paired to your computer and your phone at the same time or your tablet and your phone at the same time, you're listening to music on one thing, you get a phone call on the other and it just seamlessly automatically switches. Then you hang up and go back to music and it switches back. It'S just so much better of an experience than going into bluetooth settings unpairing, then repairing manually every time. So that's number one and it's actually been improving over time. When i first got these headphones, it didn't really work very well at all, but they've been getting software updates and through the sony, app they've gotten better. So it's fixed itself up over time and we'll probably continue to get updates and hopefully keep getting better in the future. So with that by itself to be honest, they probably could have stopped there and i would have been happy. That'S all. I really wanted, but number two. They also made the noise cancellation better than on the mark threes. Now i crown the mark iii as my active noise cancellation kings, because the noise cancellation and sound quality was so good on them that i picked them over better. Looking better feeling cooler headphones like the surface headphones because of it, and this is better so the mark iv is again sound, incredible super clean and bright and full with all the same noise cancellation controls in the sony app like before all your eq settings. But now the noise cancellation cancels out slightly more of some higher frequencies too. So it's always been amazing, with low frequency homes stuff, like airplanes and trains and rumbles that you've already known. But now, with things like dishwashers and cars and even people's voices, it cancels more of those out too now. I can't necessarily tell a difference immediately between the threes and the fours. As far as noise cancellation, it's not like a reason to buy the force, but i did notice that typing on my mechanical keyboard, which has brown switches, the clacking was generally cancelled out really well and bottom line here is you're not going to find a better pair Of noise cancellation headphones just as far as pure isolation and sound quality. So if there's a better one out there, i haven't found it yet, it's like being in another dimension, sometimes there's also technically some very slight physical adjustments to the dimensions too. The cushions are 10 larger, so that's technically an improvement and also, if you look inside the left, ear cup you'll see a proximity sensor and that's for the wear detection feature that i'll get to in a second but actually believe it or not. This helps me find, which was the left and right ear cup a little faster, but the one that really matters is the new mics. So the mark iv now has a better mic pattern with five microphones for better call quality and better voice recognition. So i've never really thought the microphone quality of wireless headphones. Was that amazing to begin with, like as long as they work? You can hear my voice, that's fine, but these actually have five microphones built into that which is an improvement, and so apparently they can cancel out background noise is better. You can hear my voice a little bit more isolated. So as long as that's true, then that's also nice. If you fire up the sony app there's again, some nice convenient features in here enabled by the sensors and mics on the headphones. You may never use these or you may be like me, and use some of them some of the time, but i'll go in order of coolest to most gimmicky here. So wear detection is unique to the mark. Fours thanks to the added sensor in the left, ear cup. So with that in the sony headphones app, you can tell it to pause music when you take the headphones off and turn the headphones off after they've been off of your head for a while to save battery, which is smart, you can also now, while the music Is playing put your hand over the right ear cup like that, and it will drop the music way down turn noise cancellation off pass through and amplify voices. So in theory, if you want to talk to someone while keeping the headphones on, you don't want to have to do the whole on off thing. You can just pull one of these and you're talking to someone, i think, that's maybe useful, sometimes on public transit or on an airplane. If we ever get to do that again, if you just want to talk to someone real quick, but as soon as you take your hand off the music comes right back and the noise cancellation is back on and you're right where you left off. So that's all right and it's fast like i think that makes a big difference to actually using the feature. If i put my hand there and you have to wait a second for it to kick in, that would be kind of disappointing. As soon as i put my hand there boom i'm listening to people, but then maybe the most gimmicky feature is the speak to chat function which basically will use the mics, and i guess other sensors in the headphone to be able to tell when i start speaking And when i do start speaking, it will pause my music turn off noise cancellation and amplify voices, so i'm wearing the headphones listening to music. I start talking it pauses, the music and now i'm having a conversation through the headphones, and i guess that's fine. It works, it was surprisingly effective at not accidentally doing it when i wasn't talking, but you know, if someone walks up to me and starts talking, i go what and then the music pauses and then i'm talking to them. Now the music is paused and i have to play it again or go back into the settings to turn the noise cancellation back on and you can. You can tell it in the settings to turn that automatically off after 15 seconds 30 seconds or 60 seconds, but generally this wasn't a feature. I found myself wanting to use very much, so you can turn it on, but i turned it off. Overall, though, these are basically my ideal headphones, you know, i think the design could be cooler if it had dials on the side like the surface headphones or maybe some more cool colors like a matte red or something like that, but generally this same matte black understated Design is totally fine with me. The same touch pad on the side. That'S cool the same google assistant or amazon alexa trigger from the custom button on the bottom. It'S fine, the same case they came with, is also fine. I have a designated place in my backpack for them and there's just really nothing fundamentally wrong with these headphones at all, and i very much appreciate that about them. So it's pretty clear. These are great and they're easy to recommend, but a nice bonus of these existing now is that the mark threes i've seen on sale as low as about 250 bucks, so i'll leave a link to those below as well. They again won't have multi-point support. So if you don't need two paired things at once, this could be a nice discount i'll. Have that link below but again mark iv is pretty sick. So thank you, sony for making this such an easy review. Thank you to the histogram t-shirt for sponsoring this video shop.mkbhd.com and thank you for watching catch. You guys, the next one peace """
dlHnleQU9tQ,Google Pixel 4a Review: Simple and Clean!,9:32,"What'S up, i'm kid bhd here, so this is it it's? Finally, here google pixel 4a, and this is a really simple one right, so the 3a was google's budget phone with a great camera right double down on that. So this 350 bucks is google's budget phone with an excellent camera, and that's really it it doesn't take long using this phone to figure that out by the time you see this, i've been using it for almost a week now and really the formula here is: keep It simple everything here is really clean and simple. I mean just for starters, look at it, you know it's. The plastic build as we've all seen, and it's all one piece, so you can see, there's no seams anywhere on the sides or the top or the bottom. Simple then there's the spec sheet. There is one size, one color, one spec simple: the whole phone is about the same size as the iphone 11 pro, but noticeably lighter. Of course, thanks to the plastic - and i like the size, i think it's a good one size to have and with that on, the front of the phone you're getting a 5.8 inch, 1080p oled display flat screen 60 hertz and that hole punch, cut out for the Selfie camera some people, don't like the hole punch to me honestly, really i've gotten used to it by now and it's better than a notch. It'S not the most incredible display, but there's definitely no big issues with it. You'Re still looking at well over 400 pixels per inch and i've noticed a pretty decent range of brightness and some good viewing angles. The no high refresh rate at this price isn't a deal breaker but we'll get to performance in a second and then the rest of this hardware package is simple. You guessed it you're on the same page. Now it's very simple: it's all matte black everything all the way around giving it not a soft touch, feel but more of like this powder coated slight texture - and i like it and of course, there's a signature. Pixel accented light green power button and actually these buttons are super clicky they're, pretty loud too. I think they're the best feeling part of this phone and there's an honestly pretty disappointing single mono speaker at the bottom. But in positive news there is still a headphone jack up top. It lives on with the budget pixel line. Now with a lot of phones back a couple years ago, i used to always have this moment where i would you know, bend it twist. It see if i can feel any weird creaking or anything happening with the phone, and i sort of slowed down and stopped doing that, because pretty much every phone now is fine in that department. Plus zach does his durability tests, but i got my pixel 4a and i started to do that a little and there is actually a little bit of bending to it. I don't know if zack's gotten his yet, but i'm pretty sure when he does and he does his test, i'm predicting it's going to snap in half. I don't think the plastic unibody build is the most durable, but on the upside, it's not glass, which means it won't shatter. So you know there's ups and downs again. With this whole thing, we have to keep the price in mind 350 bucks. So i am totally fine with a matte black unibody plastic, build also, if you're, clumsy or worried about dropping your phone. You already know channel sponsored dbrand's got you covered with their made by google certified grip case, it's grippier than the naked phone, and yes, it comes in matte, black or literally any other color. So you can check it out at the link below my favorite part of this hardware, though, and maybe it's the best example of them truly keeping it simple is the fingerprint reader still on the back same place. It was on the pixel 3a and the pixel 2 and the original pixel and the nexus 6p and the nexus 5x look. The point is this: is the tried and true place to put it zero problems with this fingerprint reader on the back here, but look? This is the pixel 4a and we all know the reason we're here and it's the cameras and they're really good spoiler alert again with photos. So there is a single camera on the back here. It kind of resembles the multi-camera setups with the rounded rectangle, but without spending the extra money for extra useless cameras, nice, and so it's just one camera and a flash 12 megapixel sensor at f 1.7 with ois. The numbers aren't too crazy, but the photos you get are exactly what we'd expect right in the same style as pixel 4., if anything just a little bit softer, but it has that confident. Contrasty high dynamic range look and great color that we're used to from the pixel, which is so awesome at this price night sight still super clean. I mean these are great photos for a 350 phone and thanks to that, i'm totally fine with it being the single camera. On the back. Like do, i miss the ultra wide a little bit yeah. I came from a phone with an ultra wide, so i guess a little bit, but at this price i'm not mad. Do i miss the depth sensor? At all i mean, with a single camera, google's been doing really good portrait mode photos of animals and humans and all kinds of objects. So i don't miss the depth sensor at all. Do i miss the 2 megapixel macro camera? No, so keeping it simple. Just works great here, i don't think anyone's going to be mad. This isn't quad cameras, and that also translates to the software experience as well. I remember when i reviewed the pixel 2. I called it. The smartest smartphone, mainly thanks to a lot of google, features on top of android. Now this budget version carries a couple less of those googly features, but i still really like the ones it has like. There is no squeeze for assistant. They couldn't build that into the hardware, but you can always swipe up diagonally from the corner and that gets you to google assistant just as fast. There is no project sole or radar sensors up in the front of this phone, but it still has rays to wake with the accelerometer and gyroscope, and you can turn this on or off and it has some of those pixel exclusive features. It has live caption available everywhere and i still love call screening and the now playing which identifies songs in the background wherever you go and keeps a running list of them like every time i switch back to a pixel. I love these features and i miss them on other phones, but also like pixel 3a performance on the 4a on this phone is not that great. Now at first, i thought it was just me over realizing it, because i just come from these super high end 120. Hertz phones, but just having a 60 hertz phone shouldn't be a death sentence for smoothness. You should phones were all 60 hertz a couple years ago and smoothness was fine, so it's a little more than that. I feel like the snapdragon. 730G is probably a lot more to blame here and i couldn't stop noticing that it just wasn't very smooth. The phone just doesn't feel fast. I guess is the main point which concerns me for how long it will last you know this is one of the bigger sticking points among a lot of the budget phones coming out now is when you extrapolate their value over time, you're kind of up against the Gold standard of iphone se, but this phone has some of the same issues. Pixel 3a had which you know didn't stop people from loving pixel 3a, as it's still a great camera in a phone for the price. But again you should know what you're getting into. But of course there is one more area where pixel 3a outperforms the numbers on paper and that's the battery, so this phone has a 3140 milliamp hour. Battery doesn't seem like that high of a number, because it's not uh the one plus nord i just reviewed - had like a 25 bigger battery. I wasn't expecting it to be great, but of course i should know better because it's a 1080p 60hz screen - and i was pleasantly surprised with the battery on the 4a. Now again, all this is quarantine lifestyle testing. So it comes with the asterisk that all the rest of the phones have had, but if i'm getting five hours of screen on time comfortably with this phone and ending the day with 10 to 20 left consistently, i don't think anyone will have problems with the pixel 4A'S battery, so simply put that's about it for this really simple phone for some people, it's kind of forgettable, but for others it's exactly what we're waiting for for this new pixel, it's doubled down on everything the 3a had going for it and lowered the price, and So for this price, the the lack of wireless charging or ip rating or glass and metal and stereo speakers and extra cameras really isn't a deal breaker. In fact, it's expected the simple plastic build as expected, the 60hz screen is fine, the biggest upside is still the camera, and the biggest downside is still the performance. It'S really just the only difference now is the existence of much more competition in this space with phones like oneplus, nord and iphone se. Now, technically, this phone undercuts them both in price, which is going to matter to a lot of people. 350 bucks is an insane price for the amount of phone you're getting here and all these features, but each each one of these phones is going to have its own distinct advantages. Iphone and nord are going to be better performers iphone's going to take better video, but you get more. Google features here, better stills camera. So it's what you want. I just really love that. It feels like google's getting a little more competitive with this pixel phone. Getting that lower price to undercut the competitors, to give you a reason to buy it. It'S great. I just hope this translates into them, making a true high-end pixel 5 flagship. Now i don't know if that's smart, to get my hopes up for that considering their track record is not very good for flagships, but that's what i'm hoping this competitiveness translates into, but we'll see if that happens either way. That'S been it pixel. 4A. Pretty simple! Thanks for watching catch, you guys in the next one peace """
Xzh8BdaaAvs,The TRUTH About OnePlus Nord!,10:20,"Hey, what's up guys, i'm kphd here and oneplus nord is here it's official, as you probably already know, by the avalanche in your sub box, or maybe not. Maybe this is the first time you're ever hearing about this phone, so i dropped my first impressions, video and all the specs and all the official stuff about a week ago. You can check out that video, if you haven't seen it already. This is the full review. I'M going to button some things up and also just talk about this place. Oneplus is in and the truth behind this phone so, like i said in that impressions, video and i'll stand by this pretty much. Every part of this phone is second best for the price, meaning there's not going to be a super standout flagship spec in any place in this phone, but all of them are going to be right up there with the best. So the display is maybe the best example of this: it's a 1080p 90 hertz oled display, so not the bleeding edge highest resolution or highest frame rate. But still quite nice and i've said i really like that. It'S a flat display and that the bezels aren't too thick now to pixel peep a little bit. I do see some off-axis rainbowing and some tint issues, but it's minor and overall this screen is better than fine and then same with the specs snapdragon 765 and i'm using the model with 12 gigs of ram and 256 gigs of storage. Now it's no 800 series and it is ufs 2.1 storage and honestly just feels a bit slower, especially with the heavier stuff like launching the big apps like the games and the camera. That'S where it's a little more noticeable. But overall it's fine. You know oxygen os for me has felt more or less like the same experience as the more expensive oneplus 8 plus you have the bonus of 5g compatibility. Now, now again, in that first impressions video, i talked about the quality of the build feels good in the hand, metal and glass - that's not entirely true or accurate about this phone, so it is glass on the front and the back and it's plastic rails along the Outsides and metal buttons, so it's metal, glass and plastic, not that there's anything wrong with plastic. We see it all the time, especially in lower priced phones and it's technically more durable than glass a lot of times here. It is painted to look like metal but, like i said, second best, okay, so the other main things that we were waiting for, the full review to talk about were the battery life and the cameras so like which do you want? First, the good news of the bad news. I think most people would probably pick the good news, which is the battery and turns out. The battery is quite good. It'S a little over 4 100 milliamp hours, as you may remember, and it was getting me comfortably through the end of all types of quarantine days. Five hours of screen on time, no problem ending the lighter days with sometimes 20 or 30 left, and it was definitely helped massively by it. Coming with the warp charger in the box, i can't understate how important that was for this phone now. It actually comes with the the european plug in the box since this phone's not coming to the us, but i happen to already have a us warp charge 30t plug already plus there's one in my car. I'Ve been a fan of fast charging for a long time. So this phone in the battery department definitely doesn't disappoint. Really it's in this price range only second place to like the crazy, the more gimmicky energizer phone types. You remember that did you guys know energizer made a phone, the battery company. That was a trip. So then the cameras, the bad news and really like it's it's more of it's just kind of a mixed bag. At this point, i really think they've fallen victim to their own marketing department's hype. So it's a quad camera system on the back all right, 48 megapixel main camera. With the hardware straight from the oneplus 8, then an 8 megapixel ultra ride camera, a two megapixel macro camera and five megapixel depth sensor. Okay, let me try to be diplomatic here. The main camera is okay, it's the same hardware as the oneplus 8, but it doesn't quite take the same photos. I found it's actually a little bit noisier a little worse overall, but definitely in the same league, decent photos. If you don't pixel peep too much, but once you zoom in you probably won't be too impressed by detail or anything like that. It'S fine, the ultrawide camera it does its job with the whole dramatic wide perspective for sure. But it's immediately soft. So, no matter what the lighting conditions, it's just lacking the resolution fundamentally to match the quality of the primary camera in a wider field of view. You'D actually need a higher resolution than the main camera to achieve this, but you know maybe that's just for flagships. Nevertheless, i'm fine that it's here so you can probably see where this is going. The 2 megapixel macro camera on the back of this phone is just unnecessary because it is so bad and i think even oneplus would know right away. It'S basically to increase the count of the cameras on the phone, and it's not actually here to be a great quality camera, and actually you want to know the biggest tell the reason you know. Oneplus knows this: uh oneplus 8 pro has a macro camera and there's actually a software feature where, if you get close to a subject, it automatically switches the camera to macro mode, because it's a good camera. It'S useful it'll be high quality. This phone - the nord, absolutely doesn't do that it never automatically switches to that separate macro camera, because often the photos from this macro camera are actually worse than if you just use the main camera and get as close as you can and then crop in. That'S not an exaggeration seriously. I try this a few times and almost every time i just take the photo from the main camera crop in a bit and when you put it next to the macro version, it's usually better, and this makes the additional camera module feel pointless and then there's the Depth camera, which in theory should make for some improved portrait shots and they they look pretty good, mostly with some occasionally quirky edge detection. But then i covered the depth sensor with my finger and kept shooting and it didn't complain once and continued to take. Basically, the same quality portrait shots. I think it's pretty clear, oneplus and a bunch of other companies, it's not just them, but in phones like this, they want to put a triple or a quad camera set up so that it looks like visually. It looks like one of those flagship phones and when you look at the spec sheet it says quad cameras just like a flagship, but because it's not and they're trying to save money. They have to cut the quality of at least that second and third camera. So here's a crazy idea - i don't know if i've said this before, but just get rid of those last two cameras that are so bad, that they're useless and put that money you save into something else, because the camera really is one of those places where you Can just cut the fat like that now a place where you can't the speaker on this phone right, it's a bad single channel. It'S a mono downward facing speaker. You can block it easily low quality tinny, not very loud. It'S just bad, but it's better than not having a speaker at all, so they just put that speaker in there and it's functional. But these cameras. The logical thing to do here is cut it down to maybe one maybe two cameras. If you need them and take the money saved and put them into other things, that might be more noticeable like wireless charging or a metal frame or just better primary cameras, but either way. That'S just my opinion. It'S something they could do but clearly have chosen not to, but that brings us to my conclusion now in case i wasn't abundantly clear. I really like this phone and with the promised two years of software updates and three years of security updates, i'm actually confident. I could easily daily this phone for a couple years and be happy, but the truth about oneplus nord is this was inevitable, like oneplus. Right now doesn't quite have the brand clout to compete at over a thousand bucks. Now that's definitely goals they're, getting there they're closing in, but still like, ask your five closest friends what they think of oneplus phones and guarantee, there's a couple of them that haven't even heard of oneplus yet, and that is tough to convince people to buy something at Over a thousand bucks from a brand they've, never heard of over apple and samsung, the dominating players and oneplus knows that. So they know their goal is and probably always has been to get to the point where they can compete and sell those high margin thousand dollar flagships. But if they do that, they're kind of abandoning what got them there in the first place, which is all this name, recognition for good high quality, cheaper phones so as their phones year after year after year, moved up and up and up over and over again in Price, it was inevitable that they had to come up with something down here, to fill in the gap, to keep building that brand cash and keep building that reputation of making good quality phones for the price. While this continues to evolve. The only difference now, though, is they can't make this a flagship killer, because they make a flagship now and they're not trying to cannibalize their own sales. So this has to be a distinctly mid-range, separate experience, separate branding, separate phone so that it doesn't interrupt with or overlap with their flagship. So honestly, we could have seen this coming when these phones came out. Do you think it's coincidence that for the first time in the years and years and years of oneplus phones, they finally added wireless charging, the ip certification? Just those last couple things people were asking them to add so that they can compete at the high price? No, they added all those things to this higher end phone to compete, of course, and make it a better phone, but also now it makes a perfect opening for a couple months later, oneplus nord to slide in and have basically all the same smart trade-offs that they've Been doing over the years with their flagships from like 2015 up until now, what are the downsides of this phone? No ip certification, no headphone, jacks sub-par cameras a little bit lower, end stuff, but just making the right cutoffs and, at the end of the day, they've made the right trade-offs if you're shopping for a phone anywhere under 500 bucks or 500 euros or 30 000 rupees Or whatever that magical price range is for you, this is something to look at no question easy to recommend easy to consider, but now i'm looking forward to the rest of what the nord range will bring, i think inevitably there's a version of this. That comes to the us and i'll, be excited waiting for that. So there you go there, you have it it's the truth about oneplus nord feel free to leave a like if you enjoyed this video and subscribe.

IEwEDTmqCEs,Asus ROG Phone 3 Review: The Spec King Returns!,11:57,"What'S up guys umhd here, so i don't know if you remember, but the winningest phone of my smartphone awards last year was the asus rog phone 2, the spec king, so that thing won the best big phone of the year that had the best battery life of The year and won the most improved award, so how do they follow it up with this? This is the asus rog phone 3., so i've been using and testing this phone alongside the oneplus nord for a couple weeks now and basically, what you need to know is. It follows very closely in a lot of the same footsteps as rog phone 2, similar design and specs and choices, but just bumped up a notch for 2020 and really there are two incredible things about this phone that continue to stick out, and that is the battery And the specs, so this design, as you can see it's kind of funny when i first saw it, i was like oh no wait. They'Re toning it down. Even more remember the first rog phone was totally wild. The second rog phone was a little toned down from that, and so i saw this third one and i got a little afraid they might have started neutering the whole gaming aesthetic to make it more of an everyday phone. But as soon as you pick it up, you quickly realize oh just kidding. This is absolutely 100 still a super unique design that they've committed to for this phone. It'S still got the rgb lit logo at the back. That can glow for notifications still got the traced lines and the little exposed slot for the heatsink and the carbon chamber. Cooling system on the side still has the custom mappable air triggers on the side which improved actually this year with better sensitivity and precision and more custom mapping options, and it still has even the offset usb-c port on the bottom. So you can charge wall, gaming and the cable doesn't get in the way and really, above all, it's still absolutely huge. It'S just so massive. This is. This is actually, i think, too, big a phone for me to want to carry it daily, and i really don't say that much. I think this this phone finally found that point for me, somewhere between the biggest flagships of samsung and oneplus. We arrived at this and i think it's the gigantic footprint that makes it too big, but you all know what it did win the best big phone of the year for a reason, and a lot of that was how well they use all this space. So they kept the stereo front-facing speakers in this phone and they are actually incredible. The stereo image they produce and the volume they achieve thanks to having all this space is second to none. Some of the absolute best speakers i've heard in the phone. The only thing is the volume curve i found kind of weird like they really don't start getting loud until you're at like 80 volume, but that's not a huge deal. They can honestly fix that quickly with a software update now again that predecessor, the rog phone 2, was that do everything in one package phone - and this is still an incredible spec sheet and we'll get to that in a second. But it does have a few things, notably missing this year. First of all, it doesn't have a headphone jack built in on the rog phone 3. there's also no official ip dust or water resistance rating and there's also no wireless charging, probably because they really wanted to keep that rgb glowing logo. On the back now the headphone jack, i was a little confused by because it's a gaming phone - and you would still think someone who wants zero lag - will accept nothing less than wired audio, but it also does come in the box with this little accessory. That gives you usbc and a headphone jack on the side, so i guess it kind of makes up for it, but i do miss wireless charging in a phone that i use every day, just because at this point most phones i use and test have wireless charging. I have wireless chargers everywhere, so i do miss that all right have a look at this spec sheet. Just just look at it, i mean. Is there a single thing on this list that isn't absolutely bleeding edge top of the line? It'S got the new snapdragon 865, plus that's just starting to show up in phones now, by the way that chip is clocked at up to 3.1 gigahertz in a phone 16 gigs of ram. It'S a 1080p 144 hertz oled display up to half a terabyte of ufs, 3.1 storage and a 6 000 milliamp hour battery. Every single one of those numbers is is the biggest or the highest. You can basically find or put in a phone. It'S all top shelf parts, but something that i think a lot of people forget is. You also have to consider the best way to transition from all those big numbers to actual user experience is great software and asus software. It'S okay to me! It'S getting better, but it's definitely not perfect, really, there's a lot of subtle things like animations and unlocking and transitions and just occasional places in the ui, where it hiccups just a tiny bit, and i notice it now. That'S just me, and a lot of people haven't used a bunch of other high end high refresh rate phones. They may never notice this stuff, but most of the time, this phone is super smooth right up. Next to the other 144hz phone, i've used as the smoothest phone i've ever tested, so that's worth noting and overall performance, as you would expect from that. Spec sheet has been great and, yes, i did leave on 144 hertz maxed out all the time, because there really isn't much of a downside right you can. This phone is going to let you go between 60 90, 120 and 144 hertz. I leave it maxed out because you can't really hurt the battery much it's so huge and it's only a 1080p screen, so the specs can clearly handle it. So yeah i paid for all the hurts might as well use them. But let's talk about that battery, so this phone again has a 6 000 milliamp hour battery, which is again the biggest battery i've ever used in a phone plus this year. There'S also 30 watt fast charging supported and you guys already know i've tested many other big phones in the past thick boys like this, and none of them have actually gotten me through two days. You know some of them get to the end of the day with like 40 left. Some of them will get a whole day and a half, but none of them have actually really gotten me a comfortable two days, but i was i was testing this a little while back and sure enough. I had a pretty light day and i actually ended a day with 52 battery left at like 10 30 p.m, and when i saw that i was like wow, i'm ending the day with more than half my battery. Let'S just try it. Let'S just see. If i can go a full two days on this phone, so i didn't charge it. I woke up the next day and i went through an entire new day and i got to the end of that day. I think at 9. 30 p.m. I had three percent battery lift and it was about six hours of screen on time, so there was some gaming, some navigation, but two light days in a row. I made it to the end of the second day at 144 hertz. That is incredibly impressive. Again, i mean i expect nothing less from a just a huge battery like that, but two full days of light use easily over a day of heavy use at 144. Hertz dude. If you put this down to like 60 or 90 hertz, just because you have a long time where you're not gon na be able to plug in this, is a legit two-day phone and icing on the cake is the fast charging too so 30 watts? It might not seem super fast, but just think about this when you're quick charging you get the fastest charging speeds from about zero to 60 65 percent before it levels off, and you get closer to full. That'S how batteries work well when you're charging on this phone with this huge battery, the quick couple minutes of charge from zero to 65 just got you 4 000 milliamp hours. So charging is fast. The battery lasts forever. You can use less charge cycles, so the battery stays healthy for longer. It'S just all great and honestly, it's probably a lock again for the battery award this year. Okay, you got triple cameras on the back um. We all know we're not buying a gaming phone for the cameras. None of them in the past have had a good reputation for cameras, but didn't stop me from testing it, and my findings lined up probably exactly what you'd expect pretty mediocre set of cameras. So you have a 64 megapixel main camera, it's a big number and then a 13 megapixel ultra wide and a 5 megapixel macro camera. To me, this macro camera in a gaming phone is the perfect example of just adding the cheapest extra camera. To just be able to say you have triple cameras. But honestly, i really don't think people are looking to just buy the phone with more cameras. Dear smartphone manufacturers, if you have the choice between adding a bad macro camera or one that people won't very often use or just not adding it, you can just not add it so shots from the main camera are passable. When you give it enough light, so daytime shots are fine, but as soon as you get into those tougher situations like with higher dynamic range or just low light in general, they definitely fall apart, and the ultra wide and macro are just much softer, no matter how Good, the light is, i mean they did their job. The ultra wide is definitely very wide. It'S 125 degrees and the macro lens does in fact close focus, but let's not get carried away. People aren't buying this phone for the cameras, i'm actually more confused. Why? There'S still a camera bump on the back of the phone at all on maybe the thickest flagship phone of the year. Surely they could have fit the cameras into the chassis with no bump, but i guess not all these features and all these specs packed into this phone had me reconsidering, like the original question, when we first started getting these gaming phones, which is, does it make sense To make to buy a gaming phone - and i think the answer for a really small group of people is yes, people that play a lot of well-optimized games on their phone and want the best possible experience for that will enjoy this phone and things like air triggers And the faster refresh rate and the snappier response, time of the display and the gaming specific features like x mode x, that throttles up the cpu and game genie that lets you. You know feature hub for stuff, like recording the screen and silencing notifications and clearing out ram for a little bit of extra performance, all that stuff for that tiny group of people sure, but for the rest of us, these really just end up being glorified or really Nice, media machines, media consumption phones, big screen, big speakers, big battery high refresh, like watching videos, scrolling instagram like this is an amazing phone for that and that's fine too. But for those who really know what they're getting into rog phone 3 is a beast of a phone. So that's been it thanks for watching and thanks to expressvpn for sponsoring this video. So in a previous video i mentioned that expressvpn is more trustworthy because they run their servers in ram. But what does that actually mean? Well, when you use the internet like normal, your isp, your internet service provider, so comcast verizon, whoever it is routes your data to whatever sites you're visiting but see. The problem is because all that information is going through your isp every time and they can store logs on all that stuff in the us. They'Re legally allowed to sell that data. But when you're using expressvpn you're rerouting your traffic through the expressvpn encrypted servers. So the isp can only see that you're communicating with the vpn server and not any of the websites you're visiting or what you're doing online. Now you might be thinking, that's nice, but now the vpn can just log all of what i'm doing online and that's smart to think many vpns claim to have a no log policy, but expressvpn's trusted server. Technology means they're the first vpn to engineer all their servers to only run in ram, so they can't retain logs even by accident, because the machines reset on every reboot and expressvpn is so confident and their no logs claim that they've even had pwc come in and Audit, their technology, so it's kind of a no-brainer for all of us to be using expressvpn. So if you haven't gotten on the train, yet you can join the link is in the description. Expressvpn.Com mkbhd will get you an extra three months free. So there you go a little extra for you thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace. """
QZgIArBFmmE,Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus: The Go-To!,7:03,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm cabby HD here, so a pretty general theory. I'Ve had gone for a while. Now is every product category, that's well-established enough has a go to like an easy to recommend checks. All the boxes safe, bet straight shot right down the middle like. If you want a mouse, there's the Logitech MX series that's been around. If you want a microphone, the shore sm7b is like the standard for phones. It'S like the iPhone now. This doesn't mean that this is the one for everyone. In fact, it usually isn't for everyone. You use that as sort of a starting point and then, when you find that the values you have and the things you like, then you veer off into the alternatives that you might pay more for, but there's always that starting go-to and so for wireless earbuds. That aren't air pods, the go-to is the Samsung Galaxy buds plus for sure 100 %, and they should be now that doesn't mean they're perfect. That doesn't mean they're for everyone, but they check all of the fundamental boxes that make them incredibly easy to recommend and enjoy they're pretty great. So what's so great about these $ 150 wireless earbuds? Well, when you look at what you want from these, they got to be small check. They got to be lightweight check, they got to fit in your ears and that's a check for me. They do fit well in my ear comfortably thanks to the rubber tips, unlike air pods, and they actually create a sort of a passive seal. Now they're, not active noise-cancelling, but you know at this price. You don't really see that that much, but the seal is actually enough that I don't miss it that much and I realize everyone's ears are different, so you know different people will have slightly different fits, but I was really impressed with the fit of these ear buds. Now snug they are in my ear now. I personally still rather have an active noise cancellation version of these. That'S for my values and what I like so if they made that, like a pro version, I'd be super cool with that, but even just putting these in my ear, I feel like I'm talking louder cuz. They create that seal and dim down the environment and by the time you start playing music. You don't really hear much else so for flying and mass transit and construction and loud stuff. Maybe this isn't the way to go, but generally for everyday use, pretty good. So they're comfortable, they have a legitimate best-in-class 11 hour battery life for music listening, which is mostly what I do with earbuds and that's great and fast charging, but honestly being able to go a full week of casual listening and not having any battery anxiety till like The last day of the week is awesome and, in speaking of charging the case these sit in are also pretty textbook. You can't forget about the case. It'S small and slim it's just as pocketable and lightweight as air pods, and it has USB type-c for charging and it's also capable of wireless charging. If you want to put it on the back of your phone or on any wireless charger. It'Ll, do that too, and it even has a nice hinge, weight and magnets for the lid to open and close with a satisfying click. It'S maybe not quite as satisfying as pixel buds, but that's a pretty good click. The buds are built well, they have this sort of a rubber fin around the outside that helps them seat in your ear, instead of like one little piece poking out that can get kind of painful, and I found that this is enough to stay in my ears. Really well not quite as locked in as say, the Jaybirds, with the full-on wingtips on those things, but locked in enough that I felt comfortable working out in them. It had no problems, they stay in my ears and speaking of working out. These are I px. 2 rated, so some sweat is fine. Now I still, I would say they shouldn't be dedicated, workout headphones, like maybe power beats or anything ipx7 certified. But if you wear them everyday and you like happen to step out and sweat while wearing them or do a quick workout, they are fine and then the touch controls are also really simple. Both earbuds have that pretty large touchpad surface and that's where you play pause. That'S where you fast-forward accept calls long press for assistant all that stuff. I'Ve been using them with my 1 8 pro, so they call Google assistant, not Bixby, but they worked fine with any Android phone or iPhone for that matter, but they do work a little bit better with a Samsung phone, because then you can get the galaxy Budds App and that gives you a little more control over customizing media controls and ambient sound pastor, but generally, even without that app they've been rock-solid, no connection issues even walking across the studio, leaving my phone over here having them in my backpack no problem and then the Sound from these guys was really quite good. I was very impressed and happy with the sound from these. They have what I would call a very full sound. They have a big, rich, full bass, crisp clean mids and highs no background hiss. These are tuned by AKG and they're, proud to put their name on it, and I can see why the only complaint I could see coming from a different pair of earbuds or headphones is. These may actually feel a bit bass heavy if you're not used to all this, but they can turn that down in the EQ quite easily. But I'll tell you right now. I won't be doing that. I listen to a lot of music and the way they sound out. The box is great, it's already great for music. I think I'd go so far as to say these are the best sounding non noise. Canceling wireless earbuds. I'Ve tried he's the truth right now. Honestly, it makes me kind of wish I brought them out on the channel sooner. I don't really have anything bad to say about these, but I'm gon na nitpick, because that's what you do and that's how you get products to be better the next time around. I'M sure Samsung's working on a next version of these. So what I'll say is these? Don'T really look that great to me, I feel like they could do with a little bit better of a design. I mean, I guess almost none really look that great. But to me pixel buds do look really good and I love the colors. I wish air pods did colors too like this, but I don't know for some reason. It looks like it feels like cheap plastic. To me. I think maybe a matte finish that the more premium ones got going on looks better, and I think that could have saved these a bit too, but look Galaxy buds plus it's the go-to. Just remember the name. You know they. The battery life, I think, is their best feature and that's a nice relaxing comfortable feature to have be really good, but the sound is really good. The fit in my ears is really good. The microphones are pretty good and then the case is great, just checks. All the boxes, so it's like now that you know about these. You might decide. Oh okay, what I know I like I want to spend more because I want noise cancellation and then you can go, get active noise cancellation. You spend a bit more and there's plenty of options for those like the sony is an ear pods pro or we might go. You know what i like these, but i also want them to be more workout focused headphones. Then you go for something with better waterproofing or more of the wingtip fit near stuff like the Jaybirds or power beats, so there's other headphones that do plenty of things. But if there's anyone out there wondering what's the de facto set of non air pods wireless earbuds there, you go Samsung Galaxy buds plus now you know so there you have it thanks for watching, got you guys in the next one peace.

bfbyCTyHFo4,Poco F2 Pro: The Full Screen Deal!,10:26,"Oh top guys on TV HD here - and this is the polka phone f2 Pro the successor, one of the successors to the super super hyped polka phone from 2018. So this phone, like the first one, will not be on sale in the US, but in markets like India and the Philippines. This phone is fire for about 500 bucks when you translate it. So it's not quite the same thing as the original, which was like the maximum value for $ 300. But hey, I'm okay with that, and they also have the regular polka phone f2. If you want that, but this phone is really interesting from the inside out this one checks a lot of the boxes. You'D expect to find in a high-end phone - and I guess basically they're adding the word pro here. Add that just kind of means better so from the overall build quality to all the specs and all the numbers on paper and all the included features it looking pretty complete. Not only is it a pretty big phone, but you pick it up and you immediately notice. It'S it's built. Well, it's solid to the point where it's actually a little heavier than I expected, and it's made of metal and glass, so it doesn't creak or flex at all. And then you get plenty of extras. A little accent. Color for the power button is sweet and once last time you saw a phone with both a headphone jack and an IR blaster. That is a rare combo for 2020. The top of the phone also has that pop up camera with an LED notification light, and you get this sweet emerald color, which you know I know pretty much. Every high-end phone now is a glass sandwich, so it's kind of getting predictable, but at least it still feels good in the hand and then, of course, the piece de resistance. So hey say it is this. This huge full screen, corner-to-corner, uninterrupted, display and gives you haven't noticed there are a lot of hole, punch cameras out there now, and so this doesn't have a hole. Punch doesn't have a notch and it's doing my favorite method of getting rid of the hole, punch, camera and the selfie camera. So we'll pop. Oh so now you have a full screen. Corner-To-Corner display six point: six seven inches of 1080p AM OLED and it's a flat display too no fancy curved glass, which I am totally fine with its HDR 10 plus certified and it gets up to a comfortable, but not in credible 500 nits. I'M just happy. We have displays like this on a phone of this price, though it is 60 Hertz, and I think if I was spending any more, I would definitely be looking for high refresh rate. But aside from that, it's clear that the standout feature of this already great hardware package is the screen. The fingerprint underneath is pretty good too. At this point, it's also kind of cool that this is pretty much standard. You know this used to be a high-end only feature, but now it's started to trickle down and it seems like the optical fingerprint reader under the glass is cheap enough, that almost any phone can include it and then the pop up camera here has just a little Extra little little extra flair to it, it's got the LEDs on the module itself and actually, if you go into the special features section in the settings, you can configure the front camera effects and really customize the the sound effects and the light color. For every time you open that front-facing camera. Oh, it also gives you a warning if you're doing it too many times anyway, on top of all that, it comes with this clear case which I'm learning people really like, especially for getting rid of that little camera bump. On the back, but if you're not into that which I'm usually not, then you can always grab a skin from our channel sponsor D brand to mix it up with the color or the back texture finish. You know this matte black skin has never done me wrong. So I'll link it below, but honestly, I think holding this phone. You know knowing. I know it's 500 bucks, but if I didn't know it was 500 bucks, the only thing that would tip me off that this isn't a $ 900 phone is there's a little bit of rainbow banding on the display from off axis and then also these rounded corners. I just noticed the lower end phones, for whatever reason, just usually have more swooping bigger corner radius, while the higher-end phones can tighten that up, make it sharper more boxy other trade-offs. You can't tell just from holding it. There is no wireless charging, despite the glass back and there's also no IP official, IP water and dust resistance rating. Those things cost money, oh and I just the vibration motor as it buzzes in my hand, I'm reminded about it now. You can't necessarily tell that it is a cheap phone because of a bad vibration motor, because our expensive phones with bad vibration, motors too, but it's just it's, never something you unnotice. Unless you turn haptics off you'll constantly be reminded about a bad ratalie vibration. Motor petition for everyone to just work on those just just make those better. There is a single mono speaker at the bottom of this phone, which is bad news on the spec sheet. But honestly, it gets surprisingly loud and crisp and doesn't even really distort that much at all. At high volumes, i was listening to a youtube podcast maximum volume from across the room, and it was doing great. This might be the best single mono speaker, i've ever heard in a phone. Now it is, you can still block the whole thing with one finger. That'S the downside of a single mono speaker, but they made it work here. I'Ve been using this phone for a couple days and it's got a lot of similarities from the oneplus 8 pro I was just coming from, including the same chip snapdragon 865, which means it's also 5g enabled it's about the same size as that phone and the battery Life here was actually better: it's got a hefty 47 hundred million power cell and it's only powering at 1080p, 60 Hertz display, so you'd expect great battery and it delivers great battery and for bonus points. It comes with this hefty boy in the box. This is a 30 watt. Fast charger comes with the $ 500 phone. Now, as you can tell, this is not a u.s. plug, so I've been charging it at regular speeds with the charger I already have, but good battery life plus fast charging in the box means I'm fine with no wireless charging okay. So this phone has quad cameras on the back and cameras. Here are where it becomes a little more obvious, especially to me, if you're pretending to be a high-end flagship versus actually being a high-end flagship phone. Now, when you hear 64 megapixel quad camera array capable of 8k video, I mean that's a pretty good set of numbers on paper. Now that I've used it I'll say this, camera system is capable, but it's not quite the crazy high-end you might expect just from the numbers, the main camera it's solid. It is a 64 megapixel sensor, but it's gon na spit out 16 megapixel images by default and you can see they look fine. You know, I'm not complaining. They aren't amazed photos they're, not particularly sharp or great, with colors or dynamic range, or anything like that. But nothing's terrible about them either until you get to low light. So that's fine! You wouldn't be buying this phone. You shouldn't be buying this phone for impressive image quality at a low price. You know that would be you'd be looking along the lines of pixel 3a or iPhone se, but, unlike those phones, this one also has an ultra wide camera, which is you know, cool to have it's a lot softer and not nearly as good of a camera as The main one, but at least it's fun, it serves its purpose for larger subjects and that wider field of view and then there's two more cameras. There is a 5 megapixel macro camera and a 2 megapixel depth camera. Now you might have been ready to write those off. You might have thought I was gon na write those off, but I use them expecting to write them off and I was actually fairly impressed. The depth camera seems to be doing at least something for portrait mode shots. I don't use portrait mode much, but the cutouts here look good, maybe a little artificial. If anything and the 5 megapixel macro camera is actually decent. Now I've been shooting down all those 2 megapixel macro cameras pretty hard this year because they're just bad. They look bad but somewhere. I guess between those 2 megapixel macros and this 5 megapixel, the shots got a little more usable and now macro shooting is actually fun. You can get some interesting results. Colors are a little muted, but overall, I'm not mad at them. For including this one and then the selfie camera is again fine. It'S about it on par with the main camera. It'S funny. They don't they don't watermark the selfies by default, but they do watermark everything else. But yeah look at the details. Look at the fibers! The soft cotton shopped item can be a few calm. It'S beautiful, even the 8k video is usable on this phone. Now it's kind of funny: it actually lags pretty hard when recording and playing back that 8k video on the phone, which I thought was a pretty bad sign, but then I imported it and looked at it on the computer and it looks fine so overall, this is A capable camera system, it's fun, it's not gon na give you the best quality images, and you should look elsewhere if you want that, but as far as a decent quad camera setup for 500 bucks, this phone nailed that really the software is probably the only reason. I couldn't rock this phone every day. My UI, like I said, isn't my thing and even performance to me because of my you, I didn't feel high-end like snapdragon 865 should feel smooth with a 1080p display pretty much always, but it doesn't always here. Part of that is the software part of that is also probably that I'm spoiled at this point. Getting used to all these high refresh rate displays, but I just generally felt like it should be: stuttering less and should be smoother, and there was of course, some cool features like theme selectors and the always-on display with the customizable clock and things like that. But there's also occasionally ads inside the UI and the stock apps. But if I'm just evaluating this whole phone as a package for 500 bucks, it's a deal, they did a really good job here. It'S the real deal. You know they have the the non Pro poco. F2, they have the poco x2 and then there's just a whole ton of other competition in this space. If you like different things about different budget phones - and I talked about that in the poco x2 video - so this phone is a good sign of a lot of action in that space. We might think and see that a lot of the improvement at the very high end now is pretty incremental lots of minor updates this year, but there's a lot of action down here. So this is exciting good to see thanks for watching catch, you guys the next one peace """
48bK3mmjgRE,Google Pixel Buds Review: WAY Better!,10:24,"Hey no top Gaston could be edgy here, so wireless earbuds, if you're gon na get rid of the headphone jack, you might as well make him good right. But as far as like the de facto standard wireless earbuds for Android, you think Google would make the best ones and when they finally got rid of the headphone jack in the pixel, they did make the first pixel buds, but they weren't that get they're pretty disappointing. Honestly, if they had the cable between them, they had missing features, they weren't very comfortable, so I never really recommended them. But now these these are the new 20 20 pixel buzz. Maybe you've seen them by now and they are way better. They are miles better than the previous ones that wasn't a very high bar to clear, but they vaulted so far up there now in my top three favorite wireless earbuds period, so I'll share that list at the end of this video. But let's talk about what they did so much better and why so the big bold points for these are they're 179. They have a 5 hour battery life and they don't have noise cancellation so actually, on the surface with just those specs they're, not that impressive at all right, you know pretty average battery life and no noise cancellation like some of the other premium buds. So what makes them so good and honestly it's just that they nail all the fundamentals like really well and I've just been rock-solid to use. So you can start off with the case here. It'S a sweet, soft touch, matte finish, and I like this white one and it's got a black and white contrast like I like the Panda pixel. Basically, there's matching lights, one on the inside and one on the outside and the buds just go right in and snap satisfyingly into place with the magnets pretty easily and they're strong magnets, so they're easy to get out. But once you snap them in they're not going anywhere, and it's got this satisfying snap shut with the magnets and the hinge a lot of them have this, but not all of them do the old fabric ones definitely didn't so this is sweet and it's just small. It'S just a little small little pebble case. It'S really pocketable, it's around the same size, same volume as an ear pods pro case, if you've seen that before and just as thin so on the spectrum of different case sizes for Wireless buds. These are really nice. That makes a big difference for me as far as how often I want to them around and actually use them, basically if they can fit in the tiny pocket inside the main pocket in my jeans, I'm in I'll carry these, but then, on top of all of That it's a USB type-c port on the bottom for Wired charging and there's also wireless charging. So you can drop them on a wireless charger where the coils line up like this, Nomad one or any flat one. But, ironically, not the pixel stand by Google or on the back of any phone that supports reverse wireless charging. Okay pause just that right there. Just in this new case is a lot more than many other Wireless buds can say you know so many times. The case is too big or it's not a high-quality, build like this is a nice case. Wireless charging USB type-c all this together, that's nice, so then we get to the buds. These are also white. If you want to go a little more low-key, there is also a black version and some other colors coming soon, but they're also very small to the point where the super low profile in my ear is a nice selling point. They don't stick out very far at all, like it basically just looks like a little disc in your ear, there's no stem and they stay in my ears really well, thanks to these little mini wingtip things now these are permanently attached to the buds. So they're part of the actual earbud, unlike some of the Jaybirds i've liked in the past, that are much more adjustable and you know, everybody's ears are different. So it's hard to say if this will work for everyone, but they're a great fit for me. You set them in place and you just kind of twist them into your ear and they lock into your ear and they're not going anywhere and comfort is also very good. I'M using the medium-sized rubber tips that came with them and they work great the longest. I usually have you know headphones in in a rows. Maybe three or four hours tops for like a flight or something, and that's that's about as long as I'd wear these, although I know some people keep their headphones in like all day to work in a coffee shop and I think that's pushing it for these. The wingtip at that point starts to feel like kind of a pressure point, but as far as others, I've tried the rock-solid lock in my ear, and the shape of them is great and again way better than the previous pixel buds. But then the other scenario. For me is working out in them and I've gotten really picky about work out headphones and I try. I did. I worked out in these. I went running in them and they stay in my ears hundred percent true, but I still prefer the Jaybirds with a bigger soft wingtip. Those just feel more secure and comfortable in my ear. But if you do want to double these as workout headphones, they do stay in the ear and, of course the upside is. The pixel buds are also ipx4 water-resistant. So if you want to go workout in them, they'll survive some sweat or some rain. If you go running outdoors, so all that is great, so how do they sound? That'S the big question with these, a lot of people have had some mixed opinions on them to keep it perfectly simple. They sound pretty great, I'm a fan of the sound. These guys have 12 millimeter drivers that give great detail and volume, even some impressive instrument - separation, if you're, just like sitting still and just listening, which I did for a while. No weird issues or anything with the sound and they're compatible with a great variety of stuff. Now, I think the downside some people will have is that bass is lacking a little bit of punch. You know it's a little bit lighter on the bass now this is fine for watching videos and phone calls and podcasts, but a lot of people are used to more bass while listening to music, you know if you've come from like beats or something else with heavier Bass, so you might prefer a bit of a different sound now. This is typically where I'd say: okay, go ahead and head into the EQ and add some bass back, but there is no EQ built into the pixel buds app. So that's definitely something to keep in mind if you know what kind of sound you really like, but I think the main thing to keep in mind here as far as sound is these are not active, noise-cancelling headphones, they are what's called passive noise, isolating which basically Just means the physical seal that it makes in your ear is all you get, and I guess really. I don't mind too much that they don't have it like. It would be nice. You know on one hand the noise cancellation, I've heard from the two to three hundred three hundred fifty dollar ear buds like ear pods Pro Sony, WF 1000. Xm 3. Is you know those those more expensive ones? It'S a really nice and they sound better. But these do undercut them quite a bit in price, so I guess I can't be too mad, especially when I do everything else so well: okay, extra features, so there's a lightweight pixel buds, app that you installed during the setup process when you first pair these buds On your phone - and you get some nice little extras down in there. First of all, it lays out and lets, learn all the swiping and tapping controls on the buds works on both sides for media and they're, pretty easy to learn, swipe forward or backward for volume. One tap to play pause two taps to skip forward triple tap, to go back and a long press to pull up Google assistant, I found this pretty intuitive. The only downside is the bugs are so small that you know when I was first learning these headphones. I would like miss the earbud and I'd like kind of hit, the back of it and almost knocked out of my ear when I'm trying to swipe. But I've gotten used to that over time. And let me tell you having the Google assistant in your ear. All the time pretty sweet, you just say the key word, not gon na, say it out loud, but you just say that and suddenly you're asking it questions all the time and there's just something that feels like the future, about putting your finger up to your ear. Like an FBI agent, I'm just asking it a random question and getting an answer in your ear, even if I do just keep asking it the weather over and over again, I love it. There'S also a feature called adaptive sound, which is basically supposed to change the volume of your media automatically based on the loudness of the environment you're in, but I haven't been in an environment loud enough to see if this really works well, so I don't know I Just leave this off and I select to change the volume myself and the awesome case I talked about also does quick charge. So if you find the battery is about to die, and you have a little bit of a quick break pop them in the case for ten minutes, and you get two more hours of listening time out of it, and that gives you a 24 hours total with The buds and the case battery when it comes down to it. I really liked easier, but I think they're enough to to turn me into the wearing ear buds everywhere I go guy. You know, I've never really been that person. You see people walk around with air pods like a hundred percent of the time. I guess it's something about this quarantine life of being able to walk around the house with your earbuds in, but your phone's upstairs. But you can still call up the assistant and listen the podcast, it's kind of nice and as a bonus, there is no noticeable Bluetooth lag when watching videos with the headphones or playing games, or anything like that, which is awesome. And you constantly also know your battery life thanks to the app which may give you a bit of anxiety, but I find it helpful, but it really just nails the fundamentals across the board. Biggest downside, I think, is no noise cancellation, but you know for people who have used passive noise isolating earbuds before we know. If you turn the volume up loud enough, you can't really hear anything else around you anyway. I wouldn't fly with these because it doesn't have noise cancellation, but that's just me also. The battery life is average ish and I think if they did do noise cancellation with these, the battery life would have gotten even worse and that would have been pretty bad. Maybe later they'll do a some next-gen or a more premium, pixel buds Pro and that'll be 279 and they'll do noise cancellation and a bigger battery. I could see that, but until then, these new 20 20 pixel buds nice. There are some my favorite air pods right now right alongside I'll go. This is top 3 along with ear pods Pro and galaxy buds, plus from Samsung. They are above the Sennheiser's that I love so much, even though the Sennheiser sound better, because this is so much smaller and more portable and more likely for me to use it so well done Google thumbs up for the pixel buds. This is my review unit. I'M gon na be sending it back, but I will be buying a pair and I think making them my everyday headphones. But let me know what you think: are you a you, a headphones everywhere kind of person and if so, would you get pixel buds or let me know what you think in the comment section below thanks for watching catch, you guys the next one peace """
nxf41fMX_Y4,iPhone 11 Pro Review: 6 Months Later!,9:34,"What'S up guys, I'm Kip EHD here so I've been using the iPhone 11 Pro for about six seven months now, maybe a little longer than that doesn't sound like that long. But for this weird world I live in where I'm switching between smart phones. All the time testing all these different ones, that's kind of a long time actually for me to be using one phone, one plus eight pro in the other pocket for those of you who know about the whole dual smartphone situation. So I figured you know what. Let'S do a longer term review. This is something I've seen a lot more actually on YouTube, and I really like it's um, I'm jumping in, but the original review is usually shot after one to two weeks of using the phone and there's only so much. You can pick up in that time and inevitably, after that, you not try to tweet new things that I find, but there are new findings and new things that you learn about a phone that you want to share. She follow me on Twitter. If you want to see those things when I do share them, but that's what this is about, so why not take a second look at one of the phones that seems to come up all the time months after it comes out. This is the iPhone 11 Pro revisited, plus a look forward at I phone 12. Okay. So one of the things you can get a pretty good idea of when the phone first comes out is build quality, not just how it feels in the hand, but like really how well it's actually built and iPhones have a pretty good track record, at least as Of late, you know, if lasting a long time but they're also glass and glass is glass and I've said it before. But I'll say it again until it's no longer true, I don't use a case on my phone. Never really have so. This phone just travels around just like this, so this iPhone has been in pockets in gym bags with cleats in backpacks. You know in car cupholders it gets tossed around a lot and put in a lot of different places. Now the stainless steel on the sides has held up great looks almost exactly like it did the day I got the phone which you might expect and the matte finish on. The back has done a good job of hiding some of those micro scratches a lot better than a glossy. Your phone would but the front glass not so much. Some phones get this worse than others and, from my experience, iPhones tend to get these micro scratches more ease we, but you can see on my iPhone a lot of visible, scratches all over the display, not so bad that it would. You know actually interrupt the viewing experience like a crack, but they add up as his phone gets used more and more now, I'm gon na say a lot of these are because I tend to put my phone facedown on my desk and on counters and other places Around me - and we know, there's plenty of dust and random grit that can just happen to get under there and cut the glass of the phone, but it just seems like it's worse on the iPhone than other phones. I'Ve used so I'm gon na try to get out of the laying the phone down face down. Have it internal specs have held up pretty much perfectly, and this is what I'm talking about in the initial review. When I say it's got tons of performance, headroom goes out the box. Of course, every phone feels great and the iPhone is one of the fastest feeling phones. You know one to six months later, but that's a sort of a trajectory for the two years. Three years. Four years later, when it's still one of the fastest feeling two three four year: old phones, that's thanks to the 813 Bionic and four gigs of RAM, which don't look like huge specs on paper. But this phone is on pace to be doing just fine. In four years, okay, pop quiz, what's rule number one of buying a new piece of tech, never buy a piece of tech like this, based on the promise of future software updates to come, never do that, just buy it for what it is today and if it Happens to get better over the years, then a sabonis that I think especially applies to iPhones because they never really add any crazy features like the way you know Android used to be when they would just change everything with a new software update, but it's mostly been Minor tweaks and bug fixes as definitely more stable. Now I was 13 when it first launched had a good amount of bugs and they've been ironing. Those out. I had this weird bug with Gmail attachments, but that's now fixed, Oh than that, not too wild in a way, it's kind of boring, actually, if you're hoping for something transformative and new in the software, that's not really what I get my hopes up for on an Iphone now the announcements on stage and the way they talk so smoothly about how everything's so magical they might fool you a little bit like remember. Remember the! U one chip in this phone. Remember that about you. Could you could point your iPhone at another airdrop device and it would just show up on the top of the list that hasn't really ever materialized? So when another big one was a deep fusion, remember deep fusion, there's a whole thing on stage about how a software update coming later to this new iPhone would bring deep fusion for improved detail and less noise and better sharpness in medium lighting. Now this wasn't low light that would be night mode and my modes pretty great on this phone. But it's not that and it wasn't high light either it wasn't normal daytime photos, HDR and all that takes care of it great. But this was for medium light. Well, the iPhone definitely got this software update and it definitely has deep fusion now and I definitely can't tell the difference and it doesn't even really tell you which photos were taken with deep fusion on and which ones are just regular photos so yeah. I guess the point here is to say at the end of the day it's just good old, familiar iOS running on the iPhone. Just like we all expected. There are so many future's here and there, but again not too many surprises here and yes, the cameras are still really good. I'Ve been taking great photos all the time in the months since this phone came out and also also pretty much every video you've seen on my socials. You know Twitter or Instagram, and every time I go live on Instagram. They are with almost no exceptions. All from the iPhone iOS 13.2, they finally listened and put video resolution and frame rate controls in the camera, app they're a little hard to press, but you can go from 30 to 60 to 24 and 4k to HD final okay, a couple of smaller things: battery Life has stayed really good. I switched actually to the smaller iPhone 11 Pro. I had the 11 Pro max for almost my entire use, but I guess when I reviewed the iPhone se, it kind of got me missing smaller iPhones for a while. So, for the first time, in a long time, I'm not using the absolute biggest available version of a phone, I'm using the smaller iPhone 11 Pro now - and I was wrong about 3d touch - I miss 3d touch. 3D touch was one of those things that you know it was the pressure sensitivity of underneath the screen. Apple no longer makes any devices that's or 3d touch anymore. They'Ve gone back to just haptic touch, which is just basically a long press and it's nowhere near as good 3d touch, while it wasn't necessarily taken advantage of by every single developer. It was actually a really well done and uniquely iPhone feature. It set them apart, where haptic touch is basically just that long press and it's much slower than the pressure sensitivity was so I'm not sure I wouldn't trade, some extra thickness to get 3d touch back, and I don't think I'm alone there and then face ID we're All super used to what face ID is by now, but it was supposed to get improvements and be better with this new iPhone. It'S still really good, but I think it would feel magical. It would feel amazing if they could do just a couple little things, namely shrinking the notch and making it work from more angles like from this. This sideways angle doesn't work when it's this far off and when it's sideways and upside down and other angles, it's not quite as good. So actually it doesn't work at all when it's upside down so face ID could be more magical Tim if you're listening, but actually Tim. I hope you're not listening, because let's use that as a way to segue into looking forward a bit at the iPhone 12. When you think about it, this phone can look a little bit dated can feel a bit dated. It'S got those rounded corners. It'S got the biggest notch in any phone. It'S still got the proprietary port at the bottom still got a 60 Hertz screen. It is one of the fastest feeling phones with a 60 Hertz screen, thanks to the hundred twenty Hertz touch refresh rate, but it is still 60 Hertz and of course, no 5g. Now iPhone 12 rumors floating around right now point to the boxier shape similar to the iPad pro super. Looking forward to that 5g should be added as well and adding that lidar scanner from the iPad pro a classic case of the customer paying for a feature they may not ever use just because it comes built into the phone. But now there's a whole new lineup of iPhones planned at various price points which are really interesting to me, all of which should have 5g. So I'm curious, which one of these do you think you would get look today, iPhone 11 Pro as a flagship. It'S kind of in this weird place because Apple never updates their prices. This phone launched at $ 1000 upgraded for 1100 and it still costs $ 1,100 and till the day the next phone comes out in September or October. It will still cost 1100 bucks. This phone was a pretty good buy when it came out, but if you can wait, if you waited this long and you haven't bought a new iPhone yet if you can keep waiting to the iPhone 12, I think that's the move. I think that's the one to wait for that's the one I'm excited about, that's the one I can't wait to upgrade to with that new shape, but until then this has been a pretty damn good phone for the months that's been out till then thanks for watching Catch you guys in the next one peace, """
WIVUbBIrbM4,Moto Edge+ Review: We Need to Talk!,13:10,"Hey, what's up guys mkbhd here and motorola is back in the flagship smartphone game. Do you realize how long it's been and, to be honest, i kind of miss these. You know it wasn't that long ago that i remember the moto x and the droid series being super competitive and unique, and just motorola in general, bringing a certain spice to the high-end flagship game before their absence. But then they didn't make one for a couple years. So they did budget phones for a while and they dropped a folding phone, but now it's 20 20 and they're back with a flagship. So what do they pack in well? Snapdragon 865 12 gigs of ram 256 gigs of fast ufs, 3.0 storage and a 5 000 milliamp hour battery. There'S a triple camera on the back headlined by 108 megapixel main shooter. This thing's got 5g radios and it's capped off with a 6.7 inch, 90 hertz oled display. That is massively curved around the sides. Hence the name edge plus. So there's a lot of good things here, but it's far from perfect and there are some things that are frustrating - that sort of feel like come from: motorola being rusty, making flagship phones and we got to talk about the whole curved display thing. But, first of all, i mostly really like the way this phone is built. You know it's metal and glass like any other flagship, and it has some character with the curves in the top and bottom rails that i like and yes you're, not seeing things. That is a headphone jack on a flagship phone in 2020. One of the last you'll find speaker at the bottom. That'S paired with the earpiece at the top to my ear, gets pretty loud and sounds really good, but what's funny is even as thick as this phone is the camera bump on the back for those huge cameras still sticks out even more and since it's off to The side - yes, it absolutely still rocks on a table classic, but the one thing i dislike, the most isn't the camera bump or the fingerprint magnet. That is the back of this phone. But it's because this display this waterfall display so dramatically. Curves over the edges, like the huawei mate 30 pro, it pushes the buttons on the side of the phone back from the center, so they're, not in the middle anymore. They'Re, like pushed back even further from the middle, where they'd usually be, and also i usually like when the volume buttons are on the opposite side of the phone as the power button, but they're all on one side here. But i guess that's something you can pretty easily get used to. Oh you know what else i recently noticed when you shake this phone aside from turning on the flashlight. It makes this noise. You hear that so i thought that noise was coming from the buttons like rattling inside the phone, which is like. Oh that's, not very good quality. That'S not very good feeling, but you still get that noise. When you hold the buttons down turns out that noise is coming from the giant camera and the optically image stabilized sensor inside the back of the phone here, i verified that, because the same sort of system in the galaxy s20 ultra also makes this rattling noise. So anyway, it's not an actual fault of the phone. I just felt like pointing it out, because i noticed it um these sensors are getting huge. Also, don't shake your phone that much. I missed the motorola flagship software treatment like a lot. There'S not that many like it, but it's really nice, it's relatively clean, android 10 with motorola features added. That'S always what i loved about those previous motorola flagships. If you go back and watch those old reviews, this is almost the same thing. You have the motorola actions. The double chop to turn on the flashlight, the double twist to quickly open the camera app and all that stuff is still here. There'S also motorola's couple widgets, including this time and weather one on the home screen with this weirdly low frame rate animation. But it's still pretty much mostly what i would expect, but i guess they've gotten a bit rusty, because this verizon exclusive phone has more bloatware pre-installed than i've seen on any premium phone in a long time. I actually didn't uninstall any of them yet so you can see them all here, but it came with all these games. Two different versions of candy crush um, the verizon cloud, app, a digital, secure, app, there's disney, plus and then another game and then another game sheesh. I i didn't know initially if this is a verizon thing or a motorola thing, probably a verizon thing uh but yeah. Of course you can just go through and uninstall them all one by one, but it just doesn't feel premium when you have to go through that. Also, one other little thing that doesn't feel flagship quality on this phone is the vibration motor, something that's underrated on a lot of those really good phones. This one has one that's kind of rattly and doesn't feel that great on par with, like 400 phones. I wish it was better, but the battery is one thing i can't complain about, though five thousand milliamp hours is here, it's a huge sell and that's a trend. I'M happy to see continuing in these flagships and it's translated. Well, i was getting regularly six plus hours of screen on time, which is awesome and it was lasting through the end of the day, with battery despair, which is what matters, and i guess that makes perfect sense for a phone with a 1080p display and such a Huge battery and there's also wireless charging, and it comes with a decently fast charger in the box. The one thing i'd be hesitant about well, not hesitant. Really just just to keep in mind is this is a 5g phone, that's one of their main focuses of it. On verizon, which cool great um, but i'm not in a 5g area, you might have seen my 5g explain video where i was testing verizon's millimeter wave 5g, if not i'll, leave it below the like button. But basically i live near new york city, which is one of those cities. That'S lighting up with 5g now, but that millimeter wave does not reach here from there. So i've been using this as a 4g phone. Basically, since then, so that means someday in the theoretical future they'll be lighting up 5g around here and then this phone will connect to that and it'll start getting those better speeds, but also that will draw more battery life. You know how much more we don't know, but that's why 5g phones have all had mostly bigger batteries, um, but generally 5000 million powers, i'm not complaining, and then this camera 108 megapixels now you might be thinking, wait. A second we've seen that number before and you'd be right: galaxy s20. Ultra me note 10. This is another 108 megapixel main camera and for the most part, it's pretty similar to samsung's camera matter. Of fact, the colors are quite nice and the shots are very detailed. As you'd expect, dynamic range is nice with auto hdr as well, and it's spitting out 27 megapixel photos by default and basically, if you give it a little light, you get good shots, but it struggles again. I have to mention this with the sensor being so huge and the super shallow depth of field that comes with that, especially with closer up subjects. You'Ve heard me say this before, but you know sometimes a shallow depth of field looks cool i've raved about that in the past, but to a certain limit look at this photo. I took of a sign it's crazy. It looks normal at first, but the left side of the sign is sharp and in focus, but the right side is a little out of the plane of focus. So it's blurry sheesh. Now you've probably heard me talk about this before, but the real problem here is motorola's viewfinder in their camera, app sharpens the crap out of whatever you're taking a photo of it looks it's like cranked to a hundred like you know that lightroom clarity filter, if you Just turn sharpness all the way up. It looks like an effect, so the sharpness is exaggerated, literally to a point where you can't actually tell looking through the viewfinder. If you're nailing focus or not, i took shots like this by pointing and shooting thinking focus was fine because it was sharp in the viewfinder. But then, when i looked at the picture closely - and i saw what happened, i had to take it again, and this happened. Multiple times, here's a screenshot of the viewfinder of what i'm seeing and then the photo that i got and again when you zoom in a bit. You realize it's a bit out of focus and you have to actually look at the photo to realize and take another picture. You can legitimately actually miss focus. If you don't check motorola. Why are you sharpening the viewfinder this much? You have a good camera tone. It down relax, but also, i feel like we could use that dual aperture feature again anyway, before i rant about this curved screen.

Get honey for free right now, like today, at joinhoney.com, mkbhd, that's joinhoney.com, mkbhd and thanks to honey for sponsoring this video. All right, we got ta talk about curved displays, so this phone is of course, leaning into it pretty hard. There'S some edge display features that'll glow when you get a notification um. When your alarm clock goes off the whole side thing, they really love it uh. They also named the phone the edge plus, but can we stop? I hope the world can see now. What'S really going on out here, because it's getting ridiculous, it's really ridiculous, like there was a day a few years ago, where every smartphone display was pretty much flat, but as we start to reach out towards those edges and shrink the bezels a bit samsung tried one Of the sides rolling over the edge because hey there's samsung and they can try stuff tossed a news ticker and some stocks over there and some quirky features on the side and suddenly it was a hit. People loved it because it looked cool and next thing. You know their next phone has both the sides flowing over the edges and we're loving it, and other companies are scrambling to figure out. How can we get our displays to do that too? Meanwhile, accidental touches start to become a thing, but you know what it's early they'll iron that out, but that never really fully got ironed out. Now, don't get me wrong, it still looks super cool. That'S the whole point it's. This is prime form over function, but it turns out that curve over the edges. It doesn't really seem to be worth the extra cost and the extra accidental touches. We still get no matter how much they've worked on this palm rejection software, and so now, if you look back at samsung's newest flagships, the galaxy s20 is one of the first ones. Going back to flatter displays turns out it's okay to roll back on some things. We had capacitive buttons at the bottom of phones for a long while before we just stopped that completely you don't see it anymore. We'Ve had ring flashes, we've had branded bezels, we've had flaps over ports for better water resistance, but all of those things we slowly realized. There'S better ways to do that or this isn't the best idea and now they're gone it's okay to roll back on things, and so this is my formal petition to realize that these curved over screens at least these extreme ones, these 90 degree waterfall edges. We can work it back thanks for coming to my ted talk, also not to pile on, but this is the worst fingerprint reader i've ever seen under glass ever like. I really don't know what happened here. I'Ve tried re-registering my fingerprint twice using a different finger, but this reader gives me the most failed attempts and the slowest average speed i have ever seen in an in-glass fingerprint reader. So couldn't leave that out. So, to sum it all up i've liked using this phone, but i didn't love it and when you start to shop around and compare it like the oneplus 8 pro that i just came from, has a higher resolution. A higher refresh rate screen, a better quality screen. Overall turns out about the same quality camera system, uh much faster charging, there's the same specs, a better fingerprint reader, cleaner software, no bloatware fast software updates and less of a curve around the screen. So you know the smaller battery is maybe the only downside. But what reason is there to buy the moto for 9.99? I just think it falls in that category of phones that you'd be okay with using if you got it, but there are other better phones to buy out there and i think someone's got to say it. It'S really just time to be done with those curved displays and i don't think motorola is done by any means with trying out flagships. I think they'll be back at least i hope so either way, that's been it thanks for watching catch, you guys in the next one peace. """
eNWG9KRAbCc,Apple Magic Keyboard: Floating iPad Pro?,9:14,"What'S up guys, I'm PHP here, you know there used to be entire YouTube channels, dedicated big ones, to just reviewing cases. You know laptop cases I phone cases. I never really got super into that because I was like you know how interesting could a case really be? I'M not a big case guy, but this is got to be the most interesting case, we've seen in a long time. This is the new Apple magic keyboard case for the new iPad, pro 300 bucks for the small one and 350 bucks for this bigger one, and there was a lot of hype for this case right. It was announced alongside this new iPad, which was barely actually different from the previous iPad pro, but, along with the new mouse and cursor support on the iPad, it Reese toked this whole fire of. Can the iPad pro be a full time computer? So I've been using this new iPad and this magic case as my primary computer for the past couple days and all weekend and the conclusion I've gotten to is this is the best version of the iPad as a computer for sure, but I would still rather have A laptop, let me explain so for your money. This is actually a pretty substantial like nice case. There'S a lot going on here. It'S a top part full of magnets that locks on the iPad and does not let go like it's a strong magnet pattern matching up to the iPad, then there's a hinge which is like this long metal tube through the middle, with a USB type-c pass-through port on The side for charging then a base, which is the silicon rubberized material we've seen in Apple cases before with a full-size, backlit, keyboard and trackpad, and it's a lot of material. It'S a bit thicker and heavier also than you might be. Imagining you ready for this iPad. Pro weighs this big one 640 grams and then without the iPad. The case by itself weighs another 702 grams, so it weighs more than the iPad so combined. They are thicker and heavier than a MacBook Air. And so, while it's not nearly as elegant to open and close like a laptop would be, the one thing you can say about this case is: it is well built to get this in place. Basically, you open this up and quickly. You find that the hinge has this locking point where it gets to the locking point and it snaps into place and that's nice and on the top part, continues opening like a hinge. So you've opened it like this. You take the ipad, you lock it with the magnets into the top half everything lights up, the pins are all connected, and now it's floating above the keyboard as advertised now, we've already seen iPad cases with keyboards before there's plenty people already using them. But there's a couple things that make this one so impressive number one is that hinge, it's pretty stiff like a laptop and it is limited in how far back it goes but actually find it goes just far back enough for any of my normal use. It just kind of pops off the back and hovers the iPad there. Then the keyboard is really nice. I think it's, the nicest part it's scissor switches, so it has a nice travel and it actually feels clicky like the new MacBook Air and 16 inch. Macbook Pros keys and since the board is stiff and well built, there's actually no flex at all, unlike some laptops and then it's backlit, which no doubt sucks a little bit of extra power from the iPads battery. But I like the back light. It'S a nice touch. It fades on and off and just generally yeah it's it's the best keyboard. I'Ve ever seen in an iPad case, that's fax and then, of course, there's the trackpad too. It'S not the biggest trackpad in the world like you might find on a full-size laptop, but it is nice and it definitely completes the laptop computer feel with the new iOS cursor and it clicks it really physically clicks so everywhere from corner to corner, which is nice. So now you have the iPad hovering above the keyboard here with just enough room to type and not really ever touch the iPad. Usually, for me, that's good, and so now it feels like a computer. The USB type C charging pass-through is at the bottom like where a normal computer port would be, and I seem to be getting almost a hundred percent efficiency through those pins which definitely impressed me. So it's like a real 13 inch, laptop ish computer with a hundred twenty Hertz screen and iPad OS and all of its quartz. So let me tell you: there are still a lot of quirks to this. The your main computer, first of all weight management is something we often think about with these iPad cases. In a laptop you open this by the hinge and all the weight, all the guts in the computer are at the bottom and the top is just a light weight screen. So opening and closing it pretty elegant not a whole lot of problems there, but with the iPad in this case, or any case like this, the iPad is the computer, and so most of that weight is up top, and so it can feel a little bit top-heavy. This is part of why they made this case, so heavy is to try to combat this a little bit to try to make it feel a little bit less top-heavy. But still it's not perfect. This whole thing here, it's still a pible in some positions. That'S a new word right. Laughable, most of the classic laptop positions are still fine. I know some people were wondering about this, it's better than you might expect, but from experience, it's still not as flexible as a truly bottom weighted laptop, where the hinge is just moving. The screen weight and then, if you get down to the keyboard great keyboard, like I said, physically speaking, but there's no escape key. So if I want to exit a full screen, video or use anything, you typically escape, you have to touch the screen and you've probably noticed by now. There'S no function buttons at all on this keyboard, meaning there's no brightness volume or even keyboard backlight brightness shortcuts. Here for all that, you got to touch the screen, in fact, just to change the keyboard brightness. You have to go into the Settings app into general into keyboard settings and then into keyboard hardware settings and then that's where you can manually turn up or down the keyboard. Backlight brightness. Luckily, auto brightness is typically still pretty good. It'S using the iPads sensors by the way, so that's hopefully not something you have to do very often, but still you get the point here and then also I on a Mac, I'm a I'm, a command Q person as a lot of Mac people are whenever I Want to quit an app command Q to close it, it doesn't quite work the same way here. If you're in an app and you hit command Q, nothing happens. You have to touch the screen or command H to go home, but if you actually do want to close an app in your multitasking, without touching the screen shout out to Peter McKinnon actually for teaching me this, you go to the command tab menu and then find The app you to close in there and then command queue to close that, and then you know like normal with an iPad there's a bunch of gestures from the trackpad and keyboard shortcuts to learn. In fact, if you hold down command at any point in anything, it'll show you a list of all the keyboard shortcuts available to you at that time in that app. So that's a pretty cool pro tip, but that represents a little bit of a learning curve. If you've come from something else with a keyboard, so at the end of the day, let me let me wrap it all up with this. My MacBook Air spec is twelve hundred bucks. This iPad pro the 13-inch the same size screen, is a thousand bucks plus the $ 350 case that makes it 1350. Now, if I could only have one if I could only have a laptop with no iPad or this iPad keyboard case, which is a bit more expensive but no laptop, I really want to say I would rather have this I'd rather have like the ability to pop Off and have an iPad at any time, and then when I want to type I got the keyboard and I can go back and forth and it's much more fun. It'S a hundred twenty Hertz. It'S got way more apps, there's cameras. If I need them. This is just more fun, but I still need that laptop sometimes, and for me, that's especially when multitasking like, if I'm writing the review on the keyboard, and I have Spotify playing in the background - and I just want to skip to the next song - there's no button For it I have to go over into Spotify and then swipe and then come like have you ever tried to be on a zoom call and take notes at the same time in an iPad? Good luck! It'S not! It doesn't work, but all that being said in iPad land, there are two types of people in this world: those who get a case or a folio or a keyboard for their iPad and they keep it in it all the time they never take it out. That'S just the way the iPad is now or those who get a keyboard or case and pop it out and use it mostly like an iPad all the time and then sometimes they need to type so they'll pop it in here type away. It becomes a typing machine, then, when they're done pop, it back out, use it as an iPad again for that second type of person, this set up this accessory is the best possible version of the iPad. This is a go. This is awesome, go for it spring. The 300 bucks, but for me I'm not getting rid of my laptop, that's been it thanks for watching catchy has the next one peace """
OHP1rLwR6r8,OnePlus 8 Review: Special No More!,10:22,"Hey, what's up guys mkbhd here and this this is one plus eight now oneplus didn't just also come out with a one plus eight pro. This is the phone. One plus would mark it as flagship killer right, but we all see oneplus slowly moving away from that direction. Now they have a different slogan fast and smooth, and you can tell they're getting away from the flagship killer thing now that they actually make a flagship. But this is exactly what I'd expect from the oneplus that I feel like we've always known, so this interstellar glow one plus eight star set $ 6.99 and it has the bleeding edge high-end specs you'd want for fast performance, snapdragon 865 with the 5g modems in there. Eight or twelve gigs of fast Ram, ufs, 3.0 storage, Wi-Fi six, like that's all nice. It'S a fast phone, definitely love that. But there are a few things here: cut down to save cost and I'll. Compare this a lot to the 1 8 pro. So if you haven't watched that it's the previous video, firstly pull the like button, if you want to watch it to catch up, that's there, but the story is if you work for one plus, and you started off with this nine hundred two thousand dollar phone and You'Re like alright, what are we gon na cut out of this phone to get the price way down, but still give people a pretty close to a flagship experience? What would we do well? This is what they did. First of all, its overall a bit of a smaller form factor now it's by no means a small phone. It'S definitely still big. It has a six point, five five inch display, which makes it still a little taller than the iPhone 11 pro max. So it's not small, but it is a little bit smaller than the eight pro and it's also definitely lighter. It'S noticeably lighter to me it's 180 grams on paper to be exact and to me it feels comfortable in the hand, then there's that display. It still has the optical fingerprint reader, underneath it's still HDR 10 plus certified and still super color, accurate and much brighter than last year, which is key. So it's super visible outdoors, but now it's 1080p resolution instead of 1440. That'S a smart move that they've done in the past, and it's also now high refresh rate at 90 Hertz instead of 120 Hertz I'd love to get blind tested on this. But I've said I can personally see the difference between 90 and 120 Hertz. But it's small and you have to be looking for it, but I'll definitely prefer either of those two 60 Hertz, because that difference is visually huge. So this is still high refresh rate, so this is a cost-saving trade-off. That makes perfect sense. It'S still a really smooth responsive screen. We'Ve seen other phones bring high refresh rate down in price, so it doesn't really make this one stand out anymore like it used to, but that's not a complaint at all, I'm clearly a fan of high refresh rate and I'm glad to see it everywhere, plus if You'Re, if you're still in the mindset of you work for oneplus and you're, trying to cut down on things you get to say you know, high refresh rate and high resolution are nice. But if you go too high on those things you cut into battery life, so we're giving you 90 Hertz and 1080p and that's a good balance to still give you fast and smooth while being friendly to your battery and that's turned out to be absolutely true. This phone has a 4300 milliamp hour battery and it's been impressively good on battery life lasting me easily. Through the end of every day, I've tested it with like 15 to 20 percent left over. So it's honestly slightly better battery life than the eight pro which I've been running maxed out. So I guess I should expect that so then, there's three more trade-offs: ip68 wireless charging and the cameras. The oneplus 8 doesn't have an IP 68 water and dust resistance certification. But this is another one of those instances where oneplus would probably claim they've put the necessary seals and pieces inside the phone and tested it themselves, but then passed on the savings of not getting it officially tested. I don't know about that. I haven't tested mine I'll wait for the jury, rig everything test to see those seals. Thank you very much, but then this phone straight up doesn't have wireless charging at all same deals last year. It has a glass back, but it doesn't have the wireless charging coil to take advantage of that glass back now at 700 bucks. There are a way lower number of phones at this price that don't have wireless charging. So it's much harder to justify, but that's always been. I guess one plusses thing you know saying wireless charging isn't fast enough for their standards. So again, there's still fast. Water charging here still warped charge 30 T so zero to 50 % in 25 minutes, and it's included in the box too. So all that good stuff, but yet no wireless charging. It kind of makes me wonder how much per unit like that would cost like. Could they have just swallowed their pride and put in just an ordinary wireless charging coil on the phone and just been like? You know what? Finally, we added it probably, but you know, then again they are trying to save money. But anyway, last but not least, there is a different and lesser camera array in the oneplus 8 on paper. It'S a 48 megapixel main sensor and a different one from the pro then a 16 megapixel ultra wide camera and a dedicated 2 megapixel macro no telephoto. And to me, that's the correct one to leave out, but it's funny, there's still a telephoto button in the camera. App which punches into 2x but like LG, did with the v60. That'S just a digital crop in from the main sensor, which honestly looks just as good, if not better than a cheap telephoto would have now. This dedicated macro camera, it's kind of fun, but honestly, not very good quality, and I'm not just saying that, because it's 2 megapixels like it's just lacking quality, it's not a great dynamic range and not great color. Overall quality is pretty lacking, so you know I have some fun taking some macros with it, but I think it's one of those cameras that you'd forget about after the first week and then the main camera it does have a 48 megapixel number attached to it. But again it's a step down from flagship quality in sharpness and detail, and in colors and just overall performance I mean it feels like the classic one plus of the past amazing everything else on the phone subpar camera. Honestly, if you're serious about camera quality, you probably shouldn't be looking at this phone. You should check out something like the pixel 3a or even the brand-new air quotes brand new iPhone. Se, which looks like it'll have a flagship quality camera for 399. An iPhone quality camera for 399, so definitely stay tuned for the video. When I get my hands on that phone very soon should be a fun. Video also in case you've been wondering what color this phone is just because it's it's looked like a different color and like every shot in this video. This interstellar glow is a nightmare honestly, it's definitely unique I'll give it that this finish, underneath the gives it a different refraction index from different angles. You get all kinds of wild colors reflecting off of it, but it's a hundred percent one of those phones that looks better on camera and in promos than it does in real life. This thing catches more finger prints than the CSI agent of the month. Do I even don't even have to make this segue dangerously close to lioness territory? Well, you should you should consider something. A little more low-key channel sponsor debrand will help you clean up your act if you accidentally pull the trigger on this colorway of the phone. Personally, I think this black camo looks pretty tight, so all right, here's my summary for 1, 8, aside from the crazy color, I really like this phone. It'S got a great display, it's great performer for the price, obviously really high in specs. It'S not the king. For this price, but it's great performer - it's got the fast charging, it's included in the box. It'S got oxygen OS to which I've talked about in the past as one of my favorite Android overlays, and I frequently get software updates too. So it's it's a clean package. I could tailor this phone right now and I'd probably be super happy. It also happens to be one of the absolute cheapest, 5g compatible phones on the market right now. It'S not why I would buy it, but that is a nice bonus for longevity having the phone for four or five years. But it's not it's not amazing. It'S not it's not some special phone like it used to be, and really it's the stratification of phone prices over these past couple years that has caused this situation. Like I remember this just a couple years ago. Maybe it was longer than I think, but high-end phones used to just be like five 600 - maybe 650 bucks, 700 bucks, and so it felt like you were either reaching for racing for the top for the absolute highest end, bleeding-edge best phone or racing to the bottom. For the cheapest phone, the best budget phone and so one plus came along and it sort of slipped right in the middle, they were undercutting the flagships. They positioned the cells as flagship killers because they were somewhere in the middle. But now today we have what like 200 to $ 300 budget phones. We have our 400 500 $ 600 mid-range phones. Then we have our seven eight $ 900 premium phones. Then we four thousand eleven hundred $ 1400 ultra premium flagship phones and so there's more chaos. There'S more activity than ever at, like all of these different price ranges. So today, at this price for $ 6.99, you could get this or you could get. If you wanted a smaller phone, you could get galaxy s 10 e or if you absolutely had to have 120 Hertz, you could get the Polka phone x2 or if you had to have a gaming phone, you could get the red magic phone or, if you absolutely Wanted the best camera quality you should go for pixel 3a or even the new iPhone se plus earpods Pro plus a wireless charger. I usually don't go super in-depth with price in my reviews, just because that is one of those things that usually changes over time. But I think that's that's something I'm gon na be changing now, just because the positioning of these phones, maybe ever since, like the essential phone, sometimes is the reason why they they live or die, but yeah one plus eight, it's a nice phone, it's not special anymore, But it is one of the favorites in this awkward middle child price point of $ 6.99 to start, but yeah look around, there's a whole landscape out there. Thanks to the stratification of pricing. I guess, but maybe you can watch other videos about those other options too. Either way, thanks for watching this one catch, you guys in the next one very soon peace, """
LTDuGU38-70,OnePlus 8 Pro Review: Finally a Flagship!,15:39,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kip EHD here we're back and yeah. You got me. I'Ve been using the oneplus 8 pro daily for about two weeks now and I got ta say they did it. They finally did it. They just went ahead and made a flagship like a bonafide, complete, feelin flagship phone. Finally, now there are still a few snags and I will nitpick about those because that's what you do in a phone that starts now at nine hundred bucks, but still nevertheless, really happy to see them finally commit to something like this, and it's been a long time Coming so today, as you may have seen, one plus launched their newest highest end phone, it's the oneplus 8 pro taking yet another step up in the ladder of their phones getting slightly more expensive every year. But alongside it, they also dropped the one plus eight, which is sort of more like a premium mid-range phone that starts at $ 6.99 so that that will be its own separate video that'll come out later, once I fully daily drive this phone switched to it, give It that treatment - that's gon na, be a tough video to make without all kinds of reflections, but definitely subscribe to see that video first, when it comes out hit the red button below. If you haven't already that's coming up, but until then we're talking about this guy. The eight pro the flagship, so the bleeding edge high-end specs shouldn't be a surprise. When we see a new one plus phone, I mean beside the fact that they slowly tease out all the specs the weeks leading up to the phone's launch, it's kind of what they are known for. You know placing what feels like the highest and best available specs for the highest and performance all-in-one phone, and we still have a very familiar oneplus design and experience here to they still have their logo on the back and still things like the alert slider that I'm Surprised more phones haven't copied yet still oxygen OS one of my favorite clean Android skins with all of its features. Oh wait: stop, plus what, if the nitpicks always been with oneplus phones, one is that their cameras are always just not quite measuring up to the flagships and to that they always tend to leave out these sort of fringe features that don't feel essential, but still feel Like you should have them, if you're gon na claim that you're a flagship things like wireless charging and ip68 certification - well, guess what they finally went added this year, an improved camera, wireless charging and an official ip68 water and dust resistance rating. Finally, but you know what let me start from the top with a new design for the 1 plus 8 Pro, you can see it here. I really like a lot of it. The new matte finish and this blue color are pretty sick. I don't have a lot of matte blue phones, but this one is nice, it's punchy and clean. So it's easily my favorite blue phone - and this finish is nice. It doesn't really show too many fingerprints. Of course, you can also grab this ultra matte teardown skin from our channel sponsor D brand, which also feels great, and you can see the wireless charging coil in the back plus. It'S also got a few Easter eggs hidden in the design which are pretty dope, but anyway, yeah the shape of the phone is boxy, which I've always really liked, plus there's this new little design accent Ridge into the top of the phone. So, generally, I think it's one of the absolute better-looking phones out there, but I still get to nitpick because, like I said, a $ 900 phone, that's what's gon na happen, this camera bumped! Well, it's not as ugly as some of the others out there. It still is pretty big, like it's annoyingly rocks on a table big for sticking out of the phone that much so I got to point that out, but again you can put a case on it and get rid of that. Then you get a round to the front and you're looking at the new display, which is an upgrade to pretty much all the ways that count, but also technically, technically a slight downgrade to so. This is a six point: seven eight inch, 1440p 120 Hertz AMOLED display and it's really really good one plus and display mates say it's their most color accurate display. Ever you know the best, a plus they've ever given, etc, etc. They'Re kind of starting to sound a lot like the XO mark. At this point, look I believe you, the color is great. The calibration is great, but what I notice more often is number one. It'S definitely a lot brighter than last year, which is sweet and then of course, the flagship feature for 2024. All these new flagships, which is the smooth 120 Hertz refresh rate plus 240 Hertz, touch sampling rate, and it is awesome. I'Ve been looking forward to this couple. Specifics on it one: yes, it does let you run both high refresh rate and high resolution at the same time and that's exactly what I've been doing 1440p at hundred twenty Hertz at the expense of battery. But you know, live your life then. Yes, it is technically a variable refresh rate, so even when you have it set to 120 Hertz just like last year, it will step down to sixty Hertz, occasionally when you're just sitting around not doing anything or if you're, on a home screen or if you're in Some app that won't use that, like Waze or Google Maps or snapchat or a game or something then yes, there is still an optical fingerprint reader. Underneath that screen it doesn't appear to be any bigger or faster, but still fairly reliable. For me and yes, the edges are still curved over both sides, and this is my least favorite feature of this display. I still get accidental touches like really I I realized the idea is, it looks cool and it's edgeless and futuristic, but I think it's time to slow that down and I think Samsung's perfected, that balance this year between curving the glass a little bit and still having A flat working surface with no accidental touches so just saying, and also by now from all these Beauty angles of the screen. Certainly, you've noticed that hole-punch camera in the top left corner for the selfie shooter for the 1 8 pro hot take the pop-up camera was the pop up. Camera was better than the hole punch, and this is a downgrade like I get that the pop up camera was a moving part. I was the first to point that out a moving part and a phone is always a part to pay attention to, but we haven't had any durability problems with them for the past two years, we've seen them in phones and, of course, having that part hidden inside Allows you a fully uninterrupted screen with no hole punch and when it closes down into the phone and you're, not using it, it's blocked by the rest of the phone. So that's an added security benefit so seems like the pop up. Camera was the way to go, so why do they remove the pop up, camera and change back to a hole punch? I don't know, maybe to look a little bit more, like the other flagships, maybe to save a little bit of money, maybe maybe to guarantee the ip68 water certification, maybe just a little bit of all these things also side note. I would like to see some of these phones offering 120 Hertz screens also offer a 90 Hertz mode in between 60 and 120. So we really know we can step down to 1080p to save battery life. I think it would be nice to be able to step down 90 Hertz to save battery life just a an idea. Some of the gaming phones have done this already, but I want to see more flagships doing it. So there's a free idea, so all of the 1 8 internal specs are high-end top-end. You know snapdragon 865, eight or twelve gigs of fast lpddr4 am it's that super fast ufs, 3.0 storage and the battery also gets an upgrade because on top of all that, it's a 5g capable phone with 120 Hertz big display. So you get a four thousand five hundred ten milliamp hour battery: it's not the biggest battery in the world, but for me it did just fine. Like I said, I've been using the phone with my high brightness high GPS use at 1440p, 120 Hertz and I've been getting to the end of the day pretty comfortably. I could kill this phone in a day and I've noticed that, but if I didn't want to, I would step down to 1080p and I would say, have a lot of pixel pushing and a lot of battery and that's a nice backup to have generally. For me. I'M talking about like a six hour screen on time for this phone six and a half hours. If you want to reference back to other videos, that's really good, but also something to note is for me. The charging habits of your phone can change what you think of the battery and oneplus phones are known for having fast charging this one's no exception. You still have their high speed warp charge. 30T comes in the box and that can get you from 0 to half battery in like 25 minutes. But what's new to this phone is wireless charging. Finally, oneplus is putting the little charging coil behind the glass back and enabling wireless charging, and, on top of all that, even better, it's fast wireless charging, so 30 watt wireless charging is what they're, claiming and sharing with everyone which is really nice. That'S fast! That'S gon! Na top up from 0 to half battery in half an hour, but there's a catch, you only get fast 30 watt wireless charging with this phone. With this exact brand new $ 70 oneplus wireless charging stand, you need this accessory to get 30 watts wireless charging on the spot, and that's because it is not 30 watts of purely qi. Wireless charging, so oneplus has worked on this special high-end. Why charging tech and to be fair, it works exactly as advertised. The stand is nice. It has some little quiet fans in there and it does some special voltage and thermal management to get the peak 30 watts wireless charging out of it. But if you put another Qi enabled phone on that wireless charger, it charges slower and if you put the 1 8 pro on any other qi wireless charger, it charges slower because that tech was proprietary. So the oneplus 8 pro still supports regular qi. Wireless charging, but only universally at five watts, which is pretty slow. It'S not it's. I mean it works, but it's like it's pretty slow. So for me, I'm not gon na replace that you can't see it, but I'm not gon na replace the wireless charger at my desk with the oneplus one, because I have other Qi accessories, like my ear pods Pro or my iPhone or literally any other Qi phone. That I want to charge faster wirelessly, so I'm just gon na stick to Wired warp charging in the car and pretty much everywhere. I need it, but at home I have a pixel stand at my desk and I can just leave it there to slowly top-up over night and wake up with a hundred percent. So I'm glad to have wireless charging, but there is that little snag. So then there are the cameras, quad cameras on the back of this phone, and here are the numbers which maybe mean less than ever these days. But it's a new forty, eight megapixel main camera with. Oh is then, there's a forty eight megapixel ultra wide with macro mode, which fun fact is the same sensor as the primary camera from the oneplus 7 pro then there's a 3x telephoto camera and believe it or not. The fourth one is a five megapixel color filter camera. So that's your array and I'll just go ahead and say it. The oneplus 8 pro is a flagship quality camera right in line with galaxy s 20 and Huawei, P, 40 and just short of the pixel and the iPhone there. I said it: it's spitting out sharp 12 megapixel images with nice, dynamic range and colors a bit overexposed. Sometimes that's where it misses, but generally these are nice photos. Also sorry in advance for slightly less outdoor photos. The whole shelter-in-place Quarantine thing clearly means I also have less people subjects but yeah you can tell this is an confid nice camera no autofocus issues at all, especially when you give it some light, and even sometimes when you don't it's nice, I like it, you are Still gon na get more fringing with close-up subjects. I take a lot of close-ups subject photos and that's the downside of a big one over 1.4 inch sensor. But again, that just seems like par for the course for flagship cameras. Right now, big sensor usually sharp photos but get some fringing. When your photos are close-up subjects, the night mode is pretty good, which is nice. Max zoom is 30 X from that telephoto camera. I don't think it's very usable at 30 X, it's barely passable galaxy s. 20, Ultra is still gon na, be the zoom champ for that sort of range, but tight 10x is fine and 3x is definitely usable and I have pretty much no use for the head. Color filter camera, the selfie camera you guys have asked for it. I usually don't get too into the selfie camera in smartphones, but I'll do it I'll start taking selfies. Now it's part of the job, and I got ta say this: one still seems to struggle with proper exposure, and maybe that's gon na happen more for people with darker skin, like myself, but other than that. It'S still looking pretty good with detail, and video from this camera is also good, especially with color and stabilization at 4k, and you can see no 8k video here, but you know you're not touching the iPhone when it comes to the absolute best video quality in a Phone right now, but this is still good flagship quality. Color me impressed, I think, god I think some people took me saying that the camera was the worst part of the phone last year as like some sort of horrific flaw in it. When really it was like, the rest of the phone was so incredibly good that feat: ok, camera was the downside, but again now we're looking at a flagship. Quality, camera and they've also been notoriously pretty good, with updating them over time and getting better with camera quality. That'S been nice plus they're, probably a G cam mod in the next couple weeks. Hopefully, if you want those sweet, pixel contrast II photos so yeah thumbs up on the camera and then one plus phones have long been some of my favorites specifically because of the software and optimized experience. This is oxygen OS on top of Android 10, and that's no exception here for this phone there's tons of little tweaks and optimizations and provements and little tightened up animations all over the place. But it never feels overloaded, like some other overlays, actually removed the oxygen OS shelf to the left of the home screen, and it's just Google's Discoverer page now like a pixel and there's really high quality haptics in this phone again, I love that and then in software There'S just a couple new software features here and there that are nicely executed. There'S a new dark mode, 2.0 theme, some new dynamic, wallpapers tucked in there and just a lot of aesthetic tweaks generally, but they do a good job of not feeling overly cartoony and then there's a new motion, graphic smoothing toggle that works with certain apps. You can see the whole compatibility list here from my phone and it worked pretty well when I tried it for like two minutes, but I feel like I'm against motion, smoothing like on principle at my core. So I turned that off pretty quick. But you might remember that, what's on my phone video, with the galaxy s 20, where I go through all the things that I do, that the little subtle software tweaks to really make it my daily driver and make it behave the way I want that list of Things is so much shorter on a phone like the oneplus 8 pro or a pixel, and I yeah this. This is gon na, be my new daily driver, so long story short. They finally made a flagship. They finally did it they're charging flagship money and they're, offering pretty much everything a flagship would in a bonafide complete kind of predictable feeling way, but still it's what we're looking forward to matter of fact, let me put my predictions down for the one plus eight T Pro that'll probably come out in like six to eight months, you're, probably looking at snapdragon 865, plus, maybe a little extra RAM, probably faster charging faster qi wireless charging. I also think maybe they could use a little bit of a darker coating on the selfie camera up in the corner and maybe a special McLaren Edition phone and that's it. But in the meantime this becomes one of the easiest phones to recommend period. Even though it's the most expensive one plus phone ever, which is a nice headline to write, it still undercuts a lot of the other flagships that it's now at feature parity with, and I think this is definitely the one you should pick of those either way. That'S been it thanks for watching catch, you guys in the next one peace, """
58xXl597B_4,Samsung Galaxy S20 Review: All the Right Moves!,11:20,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kip EHD here, and this is Samsung's new flagship with the Galaxy S 20. I actually kind of like that. They'Re catching up the name to the year. So 2020 Galaxy S 20. Now I don't know that they'd say this ever publicly, but if you went to Samsung and just asked hey, what's the most important phone that you guys make every year, what's the most influential phone in your lineup will be this, it will be the new galaxy s Flagship, this is the phone that the average person sees as the Android iPhone competitor as as the big nemesis, and when you have such a big reputation to protect, you tend to not take as many risks you want to make the right safe moves in the right Places and then take the risks with other phones. So I have my buddy gender here whose youtube channel is your average consumer to help me out with this one, so you should definitely check out his channel link below so without any further ado. Let'S get into galaxy s xx, so Samsung made some moves with this phone and they're all around pretty great. It'S a new high refresh rate display a bigger battery, a new camera system and 5g, pretty simple, safe, but all good moves so I'll start with the display, because it's the best upgrade. So you might remember, I was harping all of last year on how much I love high refresh rate displays and there were naysayers, but now we're all slowly. I guess realizing how good it is now Samsung's on board with the galaxy s 20 and we've got a super fluid 120 Hertz display. It'S also point 1 inches bigger and flattened out a bit on the edges. So this is the biggest best change for the galaxy s: 20, I'm a gamer. So when I'm gaming and if the phone support I have the game - supports 120 Hertz, it's a it's a whole nother level guys it feels so different from regular games that you just fall in love immediately. There are certain types of games also that take that look better. At 120 Hertz like I, was just playing a golf game and you know it's, you know the ball flies through the air and it's smooth and everything, but a racing game where you're really trying to react quickly and stuff is coming at you, real, quick flying across The screen there's less tearing that's where 120 Hertz looks amazing, yeah and, like I said, if a month it's a month, so, needless to say, I'm a huge fan of the high refresh rate. I'Ve been saying it, but also something you notice in pretty much every phone. That'S moving up to the high refresh rate is a bigger battery to keep up with it and so galaxy s 20. Also. Does that moving from thirty four hundred to a four thousand milliamp hour battery on paper, that's pretty good! That'S a substantial gain! It'S almost twenty percent bigger and you also still have the wireless charging and you have up to 25 watt fast charging, but at the end of the day you just want battery life to hold up alright, so battery life how's your battery, been, I don't want to Spoil your video and I'm sure you'll go into detail on it, but generally on s 20. What'S that been like I mean I can pretty confidently hit five hours, uh, maybe even slightly under that, but we're talking about 4,000 milliamp hours and 120 Hertz always-on right. So I'm not gon na say I'm I'm pretty happy with it. I mean that's like that's a whole day like getting to the end of the day. No problem, oh yeah, yeah. For me, it's been about the same, like a five-hour screen on time day is pretty good. There are some days where I might need more, and so I can kill this phone in a day mm-hmm. I don't think I could say that about like that. 5,000. 6,000. Milliamp hour phones but yeah, I'm comfortable with the battery at 120 Hertz yeah - I I mean you'll, see a difference between this and like the ultra yeah for sure I think so I didn't give him the fact that here you are using it at 120 Hertz yeah. It'S worth the trade-off 120 hours. Is that good to me it feels like an even trade between high refresh rate and battery life, meaning this phone got up to 4000 milliamp hours and didn't really gain a ton or lose a ton of battery life. The ultra still has better battery life with that even bigger battery, but overall I'd give this phone a solid b-plus and then, of course, if you really want to save battery protip, you can it's like. It comes out of box of 60. Here, it's put pro tip. You can switch it back down to 60 Hertz and you will gain tests, say around 30 percent battery life by switching down. So, if you're about to have a super long day - and you know you won't - have access to a charger, you can switch down to 60 Hertz fine, longer battery life, but the rest of the internal specs as a reminder are bumped up to 2020 flagship numbers which Are just crazy, big numbers across the board, so snapdragon 865 12 gigs of ram across everyone, 128 gigs of ufs, 3.0 storage to start and all great performers, and, as I expected, this phone performs great. Actually it performs every bit as great as the s20 ultra. That'S something we don't talk about as much is the ceiling for performance in these high-end phones is pretty consistent and in a brand new phone you know going from 12 to 16. Gigs of ram doesn't make that much of a difference right now, so the s20 doesn't stutter or a lag or have any problem multitasking or holding apps on the RAM any worse than the ultra. In case, you were wondering. Alright, I got an average consumer question for you: okay cuz, I'm apparently out of touch okay. Does the average consumer miss this headphone? This is the first headphone jack being gone from a samsung flagship. It was gone from the note 10, but like this is the default Android phone, the headphone jack is gone. No is that is this a big moment for that? It'S it's a big moment. I'D say because I think it's just the willingness people are to accept that. It'S gone, yeah Samsung has been one of the last companies to really hold on to it. Yeah. I agree. I know headphone jack, not a big deal for me. It'S been like three years now of me not using a phone with the headphone jack. I have my wireless headphones, but yeah I've complained about it for a long time, yeah and then, after a while, I noticed a lot of people in my comment. Section would just be like dude get over it like. Oh, am i I'm trying to defend you guys house, if you're with it, but okay? If I stop kind of knocking companies for taking it away, yeah you're still got ta. Have the headphone jack there's a couple options left, but this is no longer one of them. So the new camera system, the last big change in these phones - is kind of funny. It'S a 12 megapixel main camera with. Oh, is a 12 megapixel ultra wide camera and a 64 megapixel, 3x telephoto camera. So, of course, the specs are a bit worse on paper, but the camera experience of the s20 in a couple of ways is actually better than the s20 ultra. That'S mainly because the s20 ultra had a couple issues that the s20 doesn't have, plus a couple of things that the s20 ultra does specifically better than most like zoom, aren't necessarily enjoy or applicable to everyone. So a typical photo from the galaxy s. 20. Camera is sharp. First of all, some may find the look over sharpened actually at times, but you can't ever really complain that it's soft and Samsung has continued to tone down and Dow back what used to be this crazy, saturated and vivid colour complex to now. A more neutral look that I like, and I still think it works. It definitely still likes bright exposures, though, and it will air on the side of overexposure, sometimes, but generally it takes nice photos plus I've had none of the s20 ultras autofocus issues thanks to dual pixel autofocus being back here and the sensor being smaller, also technically means The fringing at the edges that I talked about with the s20 ultra is less of a problem. I'M actually seeing less involuntary bokeh and less close focus, smearing and then zoom will get you to a maximum of 30 X instead of a hundred x. But i still find that's plenty, that's enough for me, like I mentioned before, I usually just zoom with my feet, but in the few instances where I can't you will get crisp or faraway shots with just this telephoto I mean videos are pretty solid, especially if you're Using like the super steady, that's really it looks so good yeah. I can shoot b roll with this and probably get away with it really. I think so. I think for the average person. Oh yeah yeah, that's true, but for us maybe maybe not, but I think regular people using this for video they're, not gon na have any complaints like things are a bit sharp you know, but for the most part, yeah pretty solid. So the 4k video on this phone looks good 8k video, while it's available and that's amazing, it's still kind of compromised again. It'S still 24 fps still has some rolling shutter and has no tracking autofocus, but really the main thing is. It doesn't even come from the main camera this time it comes from the higher resolution, 64 megapixel telephoto camera, which means it crops in a lot and is just generally harder to use. So I'd stick with the 4k video for the most part for safety, so they hit the big three with the right moves with camera battery and display they're all better. But then they have to be smart about preserving keeping the familiar good stuff, which they also did. A lot of with s20, so they kept the ultrasonic fingerprint reader and it fine. You know they kept the speaker at the bottom of the phone. That'S fine! They still have one UI, of course, and all their 25 million features still ip68 water-resistant, still expandable storage. It'S actually better button placement, meaning they got rid of the bixby button. Now they still have the hole, punch camera up at the front. It'S moved to the middle now, but it's still a small cutout and really they just kept the same general design, aesthetic and materials from galaxy s 10. I mean it's a glass sandwich in the spirit of figuring out the average consumer. I did a little poll on Twitter to try to figure out how many of you guys use a case on your phone and if I was guessing, I would have said something like 60 65 percent, but it was closer to 80 percent of you. So if you're looking for a case for the galaxy s, 20 might as well check out the grip case from channel sponsor D brand. I don't have it here, but I think Andrew does over there on the other side of the studio. You got the one with the teardown skin on it. Let me get that one over here, so yeah the grip seems to work pretty. Well, it's pretty protective, so yeah like I said a lot of the right moves. These phones also now have 5g across the board s 20 tests 20 ultra, but the regular s 20 only supports low to mid band 5g, while the s 20 plus and ultra AD millimeter wave. So you all know how I feel about 5g. I already have said you probably shouldn't buy these phones just for 5g, but it's worth noting. This will never have millimeter wave 5g, but now that we've seen what Samsung has improved and we've actually used it. This definitely still looks and feels like the default Android phone, which, if you're gon na compete. This is the thousand-dollar phone you got to measure up to and if you want to charge more than that, you got ta beat it at something and I feel like that's exactly what Samsung wanted and they're still happy to have that spot. So big thank you and shout out again to gender for the collab. You should check out his day in the life video I'll link it below the like button, where he goes over all the little nuances and things you find using a phone like this on a daily basis, but that's the galaxy s 20. Is it the best phone? No, it's not even Samsung's best phone in their lineup. That would be the ultra, but this is a better Buy. So this is the new default who's gon na beat it that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace. """
#NAME?,Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra Review: Attack of the Numbers!,18:20,"It what's up guys mkbhd here, and this is the samsung galaxy s 20 altra and it is samsung's attack of the numbers. So this is it. This huge phone here is a Samsung's highest and most expensive flagship phone ever and there's a lot of word. Samsung could have chosen to use here, they could have gone plus or max. They could have gone pro, but they went ultra ultra ultra extremist radical yeah. I think that's, that's actually pretty accurate. So if the question is how can you possibly justify a new phone that expensive Samsung's answer is by throwing all the hardware at you all the specs, every single big number? They can possibly think of that going into this phone. It looks on paper like a great idea: how could a phone with snapdragon 865 16 gigs of ram 512 gigs of ufs 3.0 a hundred and eight megapixels a hundred X, zoom 8k - five thousand milliamp hours - 120, Hertz, 1440p. 5G? How could this phone be anything other than the best? Well I'll tell you, but let's start with the design, though, just because I think it's actually the least ultra thing about this phone and it's pretty simple. Actually, it's a massive phone glass sandwich with a gigantic recognizable. Double camera bump expendable storage at the top speaker at the bottom r.i.p headphone jack. You know on one hand it kind of blends in with the smart phones of today, especially in Samsung's lineup, but on the other hand, there's no mistaking it actually remember when smartphone displays we're getting bigger and bigger, and then they first crossed over five inches, like average And then they sort of evened out a 5.3 inch and people thought it was kind of getting crazy and then Samsung, because who else came out with the Galaxy mega? That'S really a phone that came out with and named that had a 6.3 inch display. It was just hilarious like no one else would try that, but this phone was the size of a tablet with the form factor of a phone. It really was the mega phone. Yet here we are now today with galaxy s, 20, ultra bigger than any galaxy mega or any galaxy note even has ever been with a 6.9 inch display, it's huge for me. It still fits in my pocket and it's usable for me, but it might not be for everyone. Clearly giant phones aren't for everyone. I got ta say, though, for an ultra phone. The color options of glossy black glossy gray are a bit underwhelming. Of course, channel sponsor D brand will gladly step up and customize a look on the back and you can get as wild as this robot camo skin. But don't let that be a cop-out Samsung. I'M hoping for a little more variety next time till then I'll link that skin below one thing you do get from a huge phone, though, is a huge display, so just to give you the numbers, 6.9 inch diagonal 120 Hertz 1440p and stop me if you've heard This before, but Samsung has once again made the best display in any smartphone best brightness colors contrasts best viewing angles of any smartphone display. I'Ve ever seen, I feel like I'm starting to sound like display mate. It'S the highest, a plus I've ever given just you'll know it when you see it and it's not just the high-end spec in big numbers, they've also flattened out the edges of the display, so it doesn't spill over the sides anymore, and I appreciate that from a Usability perspective and I hope they keep that trend up throughout the rest of their lineup love that and if I have any gripes really it's that the ultrasonic fingerprint reader underneath the screen is basically the same as last year. There'S no real substantial improvements and that's fine. It'S still a decently fast and responsive one, and once you learn where it is with muscle memory, its kind of quick, but I was hoping these would get bigger and faster from generation to generation, and that hasn't happened. Yet now it is worth noting you don't get all the big numbers straight out the box. This phone is actually 1080p 60 Hertz out the box pretty basic, and you can either notch it up to 120, Hertz or 1440p, but not both at the same time. Personally, I'm picking 120 Hertz every single time. I was waiting for or asking for the high refresh rate from Samsung and we finally got it and it's great the difference between 60 Hertz and 120 Hertz in like a 90 % of what you're doing on your phone, which is scrolling it's fantastic and then the Display also has a 240 Hertz touch sensor, refresh, so no matter what resolution you're in it keeps it feeling snappy and responsive as expected, which is just what we've seen in these gaming phones that came before it now do. I wish they would. Let us use this phone at 120, Hertz 1440p, full resolution. At the same time, yeah I wish they would allow it right now, that's disabled! I originally thought it might be a snapdragon 865 limitation, but it turns out it's not. They just don't enable it because they probably think it would crush battery. But I say if you're paying fourteen hundred bucks for this phone - and you know what you're getting yourself into. You can still put it at 60. Hertz 1080p out the box, but let us enable it if we really want to. Maybe they can enable that with a software update - and you know just put a little disclaimer hey, you turn these both on it'll crush your battery, but you paid for the phone. So you get to turn it on alright. So let's talk about that battery 5000 milliamp hours on the s20 ultra - and this is one of those specs that usually translates pretty well from paper to real life, the bigger the battery, the better and this one's getting too big thumbs up from me. We know five thousand milliamp hours is huge, but I was just a tiny bit worried about how well it would do powering a giant bright. Six point: nine inch 120 Hertz display turns out it's perfectly fine. I'Ve been getting consistently six plus hours of screen on time. At the end of every day, easy with battery to spare heavy stuff gaming, a lot of navigation while driving and I've never killed it in a single day. So I don't even worry about it anymore. To be honest, I was thinking that I was gon na, have to take a few extra days of testing to flip it down to sixty Hertz and see how much battery that saves me. But yeah I don't have to this is an all-day phone at 120 Hertz, which is dope, but alright, let's just face it. The big numbers that you guys are probably most curious about and how well they translate, is around the back of this phone and that's the cameras. So that's that hundred and eight megapixels, that's 8k video and that's even printed on the back of this phone. The 100x spaced zoom, but as we've hopefully learned by now, numbers on the spec sheet for cameras, don't always translate super well to real-world performance. I'Ve seen about a million 64 megapixel cameras that are worse than the 12 megapixel cameras in the pixel and the iPhone. So for me, seeing how hard Samsung was leaning into this camera upgrade for the s20 ultra. My real question at the beginning of this was hey: can Samsung actually make the best camera in any smartphone? I have a lot of thoughts about this camera so right off. The bat I'm gon na say this is better in some ways, their previous cameras but worse in other ways. Actually, so it's still fall solidly in third place. For me, I still prefer photos from the pixel and the iPhone more often than images coming from Samsung, but that doesn't mean the numbers mean nothing by default. This main camera is doing binning that kicks out a 12 megapixel photo, and it is the sharpest most detailed. 12 megapixel photo out there, which I love. That'S one of the things that's my favorite about it, and these are classic Samsung bright and colorful, usually bring up, shadows and smoothing out faces. The whole thing that hasn't changed there's also the ultra wide camera, which is the softest of the three cameras, but I'm still glad it's there. It'S giving us that first-person the fun perspective and it even has Samsung's much improved night mode in ultra wide, which some others just straight-up don't do. And then there is of course, the full 108 megapixel mode that can be toggled on and, yes, that did produce a bit more detail which is useful, especially if you're planning on zooming in and cropping after you take that big photo, but for the difference in file Size and the inconvenience of always having to turn it on. I ended up not really feeling like I needed it most of the time. I was happy with the 12 megapixel shots, but if you pay a little bit more attention to that main camera, especially with close-up subjects, there's a little bit more to notice there. So keep this in mind. The main hundred eight megapixel camera is massive, like it's physically much larger than most other smartphone camera sensors and for the most part, it's a general rule, the larger the sensor, the better you're, letting in more light you get bigger pixels. It'S just a typical good thing to have a larger sensor and that's fine, but for those of us familiar with large sensor, photography and video, larger sensors have a look like that's when you start to get this naturally blurry foreground and background, and this shallow depth of Field in this case, the sensor on this phone is so big and that dual aperture feature that they've shipped in a couple previous Samsung flagships is now gone, so it is wide open at F. 1.8. All the time. These things combine to make a razor, thin plane of focus, and so things that aren't in that plane of focus by even a couple of inches or so when I took photos of closer up subjects which I do I guess more than normal, but enough to notice. This you would not only see that the background was naturally blurred without portrait mode, but really only part of the subject is actually in focus and you can see the rest is falling out of focus, but in this smeared fringe bad, looking bokeh. Normally, this isn't such a weird thing, because, with a big high quality sensor and glass, that's just the background falling naturally out of focus, but on these tiny smartphone optics, the bokeh just isn't quite as beautiful, and you really do start to notice the fringing and unnatural. Looking blurred background now, and I also think that this may have contributed to the autofocus issues you may have heard about on the s20 ultra autofocus on this phone for me has been unusually jumpy and kind of unpredictable and actually missed focus a few times, especially with Closed focus and closed subjects - and I just haven't - had a flagship phone - have issues like that in a long time, and I was trying to figure out why I think the razor thin plane of focus from not having dual aperture mode and probably some not perfectly optimized Software has made auto focus on the s20 ultra feel kind of buggy. Now Samsung has already promised some software updates. That should fix these issues and I believe they can probably mitigate a lot of these auto focus issues with software, but at the end of the day, you can't beat the physics of having a larger sensor and not-so-great optics. So I think that fringing and that very sharp fall-off of the razor fin depth of field will continue. Okay, galaxy s. 20 ultra will also shoot 8k video. That'S a new feature. These snapdragon 865 phones are getting, and that should be right up my alley. So, of course I go to test it and I am very impressed with the images you can get off a smartphone sensor, the stills you can take from the video at 33 megapixels there's some test Clips out. There. I'Ve shot some of my own just for kicks and it's fun, but it's not just simply a higher resolution version of the already pretty good 4k video there's like a laundry list of trade-offs here number one 8k is locked at 24 frames per second max can't go Above that, and since we all know, 30fps is a correct framerate, that's just a limitation of the snapdragon, a 65. It just can't quite cranked out 30fps number two. It punches in a lot, so at 4k, a normal video mode. It could shoot pretty wide without binning. For 8k, but they use an 8k window in the middle of the sensor. So when you switch to 8k mode, you see it punch in a ton which really limits what you can frame with it number three focus tracking turns off with 8k video again. This is a limitation of the processing you get with the snapdragon 865, but it was already pretty bad without dual pixel autofocus to begin with, so now it's let's be real. Really really bad for me is, if you don't have a clear or far enough away subject. It'S gon na be hunting all the time and that's really distracting it. Just doesn't look good on video, then number four, because of how much data is being processed the amount of time it takes to process from the top line to the bottom on that chip. It takes a little bit of time and that creates rolling shutter and to me it's super obvious and any footage where you're moving or turning at all, just turns into jelly. I'Ve never seen rolling shutter this bad in smartphone, video in my life and then five. The file sizes, it's a K, video, it's going to be huge, it's about ten megabytes per second! So if you take a 60 second video you're, looking at about 600 megabytes, which is kind of a pain to upload, so all that combines so 8k video on this phone. It'S great it's! It'S really cool for, like sitting still and maybe capturing some slow moving or not so much turning subjects in high resolution. And if you look around that's what most people are shooting their test clips of, but other than that. As soon as you start to move around or have to chase focus at all I'll pass, I think I'll have another year or two of measly 4k video on my smartphone and be fine. I didn't think I'd, be the one saying that, but that's the truth. Oh and you almost, let me forget, to mention the zoom the thing that's printed on the back of the phone. The 100x base zoom comes from the 48 megapixel periscope camera sitting in the side of this phone. Okay, just because you have 100x zoom doesn't mean, should use 100x zoom all the time. So my typical smartphone photo-taking behavior is I almost never zoom. I zoom with my feet, or I just switch to the ultra wide, but the s20 ultra having this periscope zoom has made it easier than ever to just like punch in on subjects further away and take crisp photos. That'S definitely true. This phone takes these sharpest images at 30x zoom I've ever seen from a phone next to Wow way, really impressive stuff. Everybody really wants to focus on the 100x like when you zoom all the way in and it's a cool demo but photos clearly don't look good at a hundred X, you're not supposed to zoom all the way into a hundred every time. Honestly, you'd have better luck. Just taking a 30x zoom photo and cropping in later, no seriously just just zoom in later, it's basically the same thing, but then there's of course, just people trashing the hundred X, zoom, because, hey you don't need a hundred X. It looks bad why they even put this on the phone, but here's the thing if you're trashing the hundred X zoom, because it looks bad at 100x and you don't think people need it but ignoring the 30x. That'S like trashing, a new speaker that comes out. That goes up to a hundred decibels because it sounds bad at a hundred decibels and no one needs it that loud, but you're, forgetting that speaker will sound better at 50 decibels, because it's in the middle of its range then the others that are maxing out at 50, so there you go. We can appreciate the good tech when it's there. I didn't mean to turn this whole video into a camera review, but hey it's one of the most important parts of the phone. So the more you know the better. So as far as numbers go, the 108 megapixel number it's there, but it's not quite there, but it helps the 100x number. It'S not really there all the time, even though it is, I guess printed there all the time and the 8k number I actually recommend against using it. So, despite all this hype, Samsung, I think, is kind of in the same place. They left off last year with their camera in third place, and maybe a software update away from closing the gap but third place, and then the rest of this phone is really Samsung doing Samsung things. If you use the Galaxy S before, you won't be shocked by anything here. One UI and it's one-handed optimizations are more important than ever because of how big this phone is, but really it's still the super familiar throw in everything, but the kitchen sink strategy. There'S a ton there's a there's: a million features on this phone. The one new feature I found really interesting was the ability to pin apps to the massive amount of RAM, so in the multitasker, if you tap the icon at the top, you can keep the app open for quick launching that loads it up into the RAM permanently And I messed around with this a bit I tried it with Spotify tried it with the camera. App tried it with my tasks, app that I launched all the time. I didn't really see much of a big difference in battery, so that's nice and the app really is truly forever open in the background ready to launch instantly. So having that much more RAM on the phone is quite useful. Also, I feel obligated to mention yes, this is a 5g phone, but you shouldn't buy this phone just for the 5g, I'm on 18 T I haven't had a single second of 5g experience on this phone, but you know if you're on t-mobile or any of the Mid band or millimeter wave using carriers, your mileage may vary so the strategy of throwing all the numbers at the phone did it work. Well, I think it mostly worked. I mean this is an excellent phone best-in-class in several ways, the display being the most incredible one and with the battery falling right in step behind it. But as we've learned, the numbers aren't everything and the question a lot of people seem to like asking is: do you need it and no of course not most people will do great with a phone half this price. You don't need this phone, but as a fan of tech, I am happy when stuff at the highest end is pushing things forward and it's at the bleeding edge and for a lot of that stuff. I do like the s20 ultra a lot and some people who use their phone a lot won't have a big problem spending a lot extra on it now shouldn't a $ 1400 phone, be pretty much perfect out the box yeah probably - and this clearly isn't perfect, but There'S a lot of really great things about it, and this is the phone I will be pocketing personally until further notice and I guess crossing my fingers for some software updates along the way. That'S been it thanks for watching catch, you guys the next one pace. """
sr2fBCzXo4g,The Banned Huawei Mate 30 Pro: Best Phone You Shouldn't Buy!,9:30,"What'S up guys, I'm Q PhD here, okay, so wha? Why was in a really odd place in 2019 being banned in the u.s.? I did an entire video about their situation, I'll leave that link right up there so because of that, every single huawei phone - that's come out since then comes with like a giant asterisk next to it, at least in the US, because it doesn't make sense to buy Here an Android phone without Google Play services and that whole connection to Android, so the new flagship came out and that's one of those, the huawei mate 30 Pro and I bought one. But I didn't really get to use it too much until now, and it turns out. This is a really really nice piece of hardware, one of my favorites of the year, but it still can't make up for this software situation. Here'S what I mean just look at this phone. This is actually one of my favorite designs of all of last year. I'Ve always been a fan of boxy designs like I've said, and this is one of those, but it's also quite unique, mainly because of this next level waterfall display. Now, I typically do not like when phone displays curve a bit over the edges. Like that's one of my complaints for the oneplus 7 pro the Galaxy S, 10, a bunch of others, but this one is so dramatic. It falls off so steeply that it gives it that boxy square look again. It gives the phone and actually pretty, futuristic and impressive. Look in the hand, it's a six and a half inch bright slightly above 1080p OLED display. It'S got the fingerprint reader underneath the glass in the middle, where it's reachable, the forehead and the chin are pretty thin and the knotch it isn't tiny, but it isn't as big as the iPhone either and overall, it just makes for a nice viewing experience, unlike any Other smartphone that's come out, but that is about where the good stuff ends. As far as the display goes, and then you start to notice the quirks as far as the Cork's and features. First of all, there is light fall-off on both edges. It'S kind of hard to capture exactly what it looks like on camera, because the light's still coming from the OLED, seems to fill that in, but looking at it in person, both sides of the phone have this darker edge to them, and then this screen curves. So far back onto the side of the phone that it is this, the phone like it actually is legitimately half of the side, and it's pushed that red power button all the way to almost the back of the phone. It'S like really offset from the center line and since it's the only button on the phone that you press everyday, you definitely notice that, and also as a matter of fact, it is the only button on this entire phone, meaning there's no volume rocker. So instead, you again use the side of the phone and literally tap on the display on the side and then swipe up and down on that side. Part of the screen to control the volume like it's a volume, rocker and then, of course, you get the feeling of that haptic motor clicking as you swipe, and you can do it wherever you want on the top half of the left or the right side of The phone it is really cool and it feels like a futuristic solution to the problem, but the more times you use it the more times it fails and or takes you two or three times to activate it and then the more you just wish she had a Regular set of buttons, but the rest of this hardware is pretty excellent, though it's not too big of a phone despite the huge screen size and a feels solid and weighty in the hand. That'S Gorilla Glass, 6 in case you're, wondering since screen protectors are probably not very protective on this phone and you've got a good sized 4500 milliamp hour battery that Nets you pretty great battery life, there's an optical fingerprint reader. Underneath the display, like I said nice and close to the bottom, so it's easy to reach and works quickly, and you do get 40 watt wired, fast charging and also 27 watt fast wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. If you're into that, then the speaker at the bottom, it's small and kind of easily blocked, but it does get pretty loud and the whole phone is ip68 water-resistant and you even get an IR blaster at the top. Remember these from back. In a day, you can program them to turn your TV on and off or just troll other nearby people and turn their TVs on and off really about. The only cons I can come up with for this phone's hardware are nitpicks, there's no headphone jack, which feels like a nitpick in 2020. Not a lot of phones in this range have them anymore. Also, the back it's glass and glass breaks, but also that camera bump is not small and it sticks out the back of the phone a little bit in a way that, like catches, a lot of lint because it's a sharp edge and it's hard to get the Dust from around the circle, if you put it in your pocket even once the expandable storage is by a proprietary nan memory card. So it's not a microSD card. Slot is technically expandable storage, but you might not be able to use the one you currently have lying around and also no high refresh rate on the display. That is a nitpick for 2019, but coming into 2020, that's starting to feel like a pretty big deal, but other than that. You can clearly tell there's a lot to like with this phone and it doesn't just stop on the outside. It gets to the inside too. You get the high silicon Karen 990, which, if you haven't heard of it, is a high-end chip, not quite matching the power of the snapdragon, a 55 but very close and with eight gigs of ram and ufs 3.0 storage. This phone is quick. It'S no slouch at all. It games, just fine Scrolls around multitasks as good as any other 60 Hertz phone and the camera hardware is beastly too we're talking. Well, you can see the quadruple cameras on the back 40 megapixel main camera at F 1.6 with oh is, and it is a big sensor at 1-over 1.7 inches, and you also have an 8 megapixel, 3x telephoto with OIS and a 40 megapixel ultra wide at F 1.8 and it's an even bigger sensor than the main camera at one over 1.5 4 inches and then that fourth sensor is a 3d time-of-flight camera plus the dual LED flash in my opinion. Now that I've actually gotten to use this more. The ultra wide best technical performance of any ultra wide that I've seen in any smart phone camera. It'S not the best camera quality, still it's kind of weird, with the colors but technically speaking, very impressive, ultra wide. The sensor is so big that I found myself just switching to the ultra wide and shooting with it all the time. It'S not super fish eye wide, and then you can still get up close and be near subjects and get a naturally blurred bokeh without needing portrait mode. Skin tones and overall color were a little weird. I think they could use some work. Dynamic range was good, though focus was on point and, of course, all those pixels give you a lot of detail that most secondary cameras are not exactly crushing, so the primary camera is good, but the ultra wide was fun, so this phone is clearly capable of doing Pretty great things, but that's the problem, is I've been using this phone and kind of having a hard time doing almost anything, see because of Huawei's relationship with the US right now me importing this phone buying it online and getting it shipped here means I get a Phone with its Android ten point, oh right now and the latest version of EMU, I also ten point: oh, but with no Google Play services and none of that connection to Google at all. This has created the biggest delta between awesome hardware and software, holding it back that i've ever seen. No play services means no google play store on this phone, which means no instagram, no gmail, no google calendar. There is, of course, a huawei app store called app gallery, but a lot of stuff is region-locked and you can change your region, but good luck. Finding pretty much anything of the same selection of apps that you'd find working functionally in the Play, Store, there's no twitter or youtube here. You can still download or sideload other apps from their respective websites if they host them so like dropbox and whatsapp, and things like that and there have been attempts to sideload Google Play services onto the phone as well, with varying levels of success. Basically, you're getting really deep into you got a know what you're doing territory here. So all this change has brought huawei phones in the u.s. anyway from very good alternatives to basically unusable, which is a shame, because this is actually kind of a really nice phone and Huawei's emui software on top of android. It'S never been my favorite, but it's actually getting better too. They have really gone out of their way and started cloning. Other popular stuff, they've seen they built a copy of apple's measure, app called it AR measure. It seems to work pretty decently. They also have smart display resolution switching in the settings to save battery and an overall much nicer cleaned up Settings app, which is important with a functional search. So yeah, it's not perfect, but they have been getting better. But now this phone is just clearly so hobbled by the lack of Google connection that it's clearly not just bad for huawei, but bad for competition like this is bad for us too. So, at the end of the day, this phone will be fine in China, and Huawei will be fine in China, where millions of their customers are, who just don't need. Google Play services at all. China is the biggest smartphone market in the world, they'll be just fine, but I'm just not about to go out of my way and recommend anyone goes in imports. One of these, like I did so moral of the story, re emphasis on the importance of software. You and me we already knew for a smartphone. You know the builds got to be good. The batteries got to be big, the displays got to be crisp, but behind the scenes with software, the battery optimization the displays, responsiveness, the quality of the camera, which you can get out of a sensor. All these things are software and that'll never be not important. Don'T forget that, thanks for watching catch, you guys the next one face. """
ctWDAdQ81B8,"16"" MacBook Pro Review: Now Do It Again!",10:41,"It was up guys mkbhd here, and this is the new 16 inch macbook pro this this right here and I'm here to tell you. This is in fact the best laptop that Apple has ever made. It'S not the one I would personally get, but it's gon na be great for a lot of people, so the 15 inch macbook pro that this replaces was their previous highest and best laptop, and it was pretty good in some ways, but it had problems real problems. It had thermal overheating problems that I've talked about in my video and it had keyboard problems, so this new version of their highest end Pro laptop, is better in every way and fixes specifically those problems. It'S kind of, like Apple hire, to listen to the people team. That'S just going through their lineup one by one during the year and fixing them based on what people have said about them. The iPad pro how people wanted functional USB type-c give the people what they want air pods Pro. Oh, you wanted better sound and a better fit in the ear and noise cancellation give the people what they want. Iphone 11 Pro, oh ultra white, is in you wanted a bigger battery with the thicker iPhone, give the people what they want. So now here they are they've derived on the MacBook Pro, so they fixed the keyboard and made it better. They made the laptop slightly thicker and gave it a bigger battery. They fix the thermal performance issues and they gave it a bigger screen with thinner bezels. Wherever this imaginary team is at Apple good looks, you did almost everything right here. So for the most part, the design is still the same, but, as you may have heard, the new 16 inch is slightly bigger in every dimension than the 15-inch MacBook Pro. It still fits in most of the same backpacks and sleeves for me. It still is fine in my peak design, everyday 20 liters, which is a smaller one. So it's not exactly the same footprint, but it's very close. Only difference, I really noticed was the slightly higher weight. It'S around 4.3 pounds now, instead of 4, but for what you get out of this slightly bigger chassis, I'll, absolutely take it. If we start at the keyboard, it's no mechanical keyboard or anything, but it's this new version which has switched back to the scissor switches and it's a significantly better typing experience than those old butterfly keys. There'S actually some real millimeter key travel. Now they should be more durable and they're just generally better to type on which, for me comes from the fact that the keys are a bit more stable, so you're back to getting more confident key presses, even when you're, not necessarily pressing in the center of the Key so yeah for me, someone who never really cared that much about the keyboard and with the new butterfly switch I just kind of got used to it. I didn't really expect to care this much about the keyboard, but now that I've been typing on it, I do it is much better, oh and they also changes the layout a bit, as you may have noticed, dedicated Escape key is now separate from the touch bar. Thankfully, which that touch bar still seems to freeze all the time for me and the touch ID sensor. The power button is also now separated on the right hand, side not as big of a deal still works great for unlocking, and then you also now have the inverted T layout for the arrow keys, which people seem really pumped about. But I honestly didn't mind the bigger sideways arrow keys at all, they're actually easier for me to hit, but whatever I'm not a complete touch, typist and then the slight extra thickness gives it a bit more room for a larger battery. In fact, the largest legally allowed battery for domestic flights in the u.s. a hundred watt hours and the battery life has been excellent, especially when you're not pushing it. I had a five hour flight where I, basically the whole time, was using airplane, Wi-Fi for email, light, web browsing and writing parts of this video and landed at about 60 %, which is nuts. Of course your mileage may vary. You know if you're editing in Final Cut Pro. Yes, the battery life is still going to be trash or, if you're doing anything heavy like that. But of course you might as well just plug in if you're doing something like that. So I do appreciate a thicker laptop for that all-day battery peace of mind. Also, the new brick, the new brick it comes with is a 96 watts, and I know probably shouldn't do this, but this is what tends to become, like my Universal charge, everything fast charger for USB type C. So the laptop my iPad pro my phone, my Sony wireless headphones, they all charge via a USB type-c. It'S like the universal, fast charger that just works with everything right, so the specs of this laptop. Here we have the Intel Core. I 9. We have 64 gigs of ram. We have these new graphics cards and 4 terabytes of storage. Here, there's also an option to go up to 8 terabytes of storage now, which is honestly incredible, and it's not even that overpriced. So while it is expensive having it be, only 2200 bucks for 8 terabytes and essentially never having to use an external drive again is actually kind of reasonable for people considering buying one of these I'd say, the order of upgrades should probably always be GPU. First, the new graphics are excellent and then I'd go upgrade the RAM and you can go up to 64, but it starts at already 16 gigs and then CPU. Now you may be saying wait. This is the same overheating I 9 CPU as the last model and you'd be right. This is the same CPU, but now because this laptop is a little bit thicker and in a bit of a larger footprint, the heatsink is a bit bigger and the fan blades are a little bit larger and they have some room to rearrange components inside in a Way that landed at 28 percent, better thermal efficiency and basically that's allowed the MacBook Pro to stay at higher clock speeds from much longer durations without throttling down and, if I'm being candid, it also just seems like it's less afraid to just spin up the fans quickly. Whenever it needs them and just be loud sometimes so the difference is you'll notice, improvements under sustained loads. So for things like rendering a large project compiling code exporting a video, a lot of things like that that people do on MacBook Pros so to bring that into daily performance. It is markedly better than the performance I got from the 15-inch MacBook Pro for those types of loads, and I still refuse to throw read raw footage at my laptop and I'll explain why in a second, but basically, I threw a ESR 4k footage at it. For the Tesla cyber truck event and a handle back just fine part of this is from better GPU, optimization in Final Cut in catallena from other video professionals. Reviewing this machine things like Premiere and DaVinci Resolve see some much more modest improvements like five to ten percent. At best, but an improvement is an improvement and better optimization will keep this thing getting better over time. So why don't? I just headed everything on the MacBook Pro well, you might know I still shoot everything in red raw, not pro res, and these are my render times for a five-minute unedited clip just to transcode an export before I even upload it. And, of course, you know these videos are a little longer than five minutes, they're, usually closer to ten, multiple Clips, color correction, graphics, whatever else so it sort of scales up from that so uh yeah, it doesn't really make sense. I still need a desktop. That'S why I travel with an iMac pro when I shoot red. I do this to myself. So ok, they fixed the keyboard. They fixed. The thermal profile performance is better. They maxed out the battery and, on top of all of that, they've improved the built-in microphone with a much better signal-to-noise ratio. So you listening to right now, it's really good for a laptop webcam, not gon na deny that I wouldn't say it's studio quality, but it's definitely very good. It'S just a shame. They paired it again with this Charmin soft 720p webcam or it could have been a pretty sweet little video setup anyway. The speakers are also improved holy crap level. They are incredible. I'Ve never heard speakers in any other laptop this good and this loud now I don't know what that means. If you're gon na you know not carry a Bluetooth speaker anymore, if or if you can just fill a room with music or listen to videos really loud whatever it is, it's gon na be great at for me, the use case was when I was in LA. I forgot the wire for my headphones so when editing that cyber truck video - I just used the built-in speakers - and this thing was the real deal even over the previous excellent macbook pro speakers. The main difference really is the new forced canceling woofers, which you'll notice offer more bass and just generally a more impressive high volume sound so to the listen to the people committee over at Apple, a round of applause well done. But while I have your attention, there's a couple other things that I think, if you want to listen to the people, that you could really do to take this laptop to the next level, the port's. First of all, I know you're not gon na bring back full-size USB, but since it's a full size laptop, maybe one or two other USB type-c ports give us six instead of four and then SD cards. I know this is something you don't want to bring back, but as far as people, I know that use a MacBook Pro or just creative professionals. I know pretty much 100 % of them use SD cards. Even I shoot these little SSDs in this camera, but for audio SD card, and I know the argument would typically be just plug in whatever accessory you have I a USB type-c, but having that SD card reader for just universal memory reading would be just just bring That back and then teehee I feel like this - is more of a nice-to-have, but having LTE or a cellular option would make it feel like more of a complete mobile workstation and be able to work on the train and more in between places that don't have Wi-Fi. I do that a lot with the iPad pro I would love to have that on a macbook pro and then, while I'm at it, I wish there was a black option, maybe even matte black, like the surface laptop. This space gray here honestly looks just kind of like a slightly darker silver. Maybe it's just me whatever you can always get more into it and dbrand it to make it whatever color you want. I do brand like every laptop I use, but the inside being black would have been cool too and then take everything. Every improvement you just made with this 16 inch MacBook Pro and do it to the 13 inch MacBook Pro, because as long as that 13 inch laptop is sitting there with those bigger bezels with that older keyboard and with that not so great thermal design. It'S gon na be really hard to keep recommending it, even though that's the size of laptop that I'm more likely to want so wrap that all up in the 13-inch make it a 14 inch macbook pro, and that would be pretty sweet. There'S rumours Apple may do this around the next gen that Intel 10th gen and that would be fantastic but we'll just have to see but yeah in the meantime. Overall, this is the best laptop they've ever made as it should be, and I hope this imaginary committee at Apple that I just made up - and I hope actually exists - keeps doing their thing across the rest of the Apple lineup. Also, speaking of doing your thing, only a couple days left less than a week to get in on this drop of mkbhd merch. If you want to get it for the holidays or if you know someone who wants to get it for the holidays - and this is your time to get in - you know what to do - link is below until the next one. Thank you very much for watching catch. You later peace, """
cG8PXdTlDag,AirPods Pro Review: Imperfectly Perfect!,9:37,"What'S up guys, um could be HD here, earpods Pro, I guess a lot of people care about these ear. Pods became the most popular headphones on planet Earth pretty quickly within about two or three years of them coming out, and so smartly apples decided to follow up with and capitalize on that with a professional version of them. Aka one with noise cancellation and a couple extra new features, they're pretty good, so we all know they're $ 250 and are not actually replacing air pods to as much as they're living on the site alongside them and so they're, not just the new air pods, but They'Re also the best of air pods. So in that impressions video, I went over each of the new features of ear pods Pro and what it does, and so now that I've been using them for about a week, it's time to go over how good each of those things actually is. So, let's start with the new design, the ever so me mobile new design. I think they're, fine, I'm not really in love with any earbud design at the moment. So really any improvement from air pods to is good to see. So. The stems here are shorter, which is good. It technically brings the microphone further from your mouth, but they sound just as good for phone calls. Then at the bottom of the stem. You have a force sensor instead of touch sensor now so you're squeezing to play pause. Double squeezing to move to the next track, long squeeze to turn on noise cancellation. It was annoying at first because the shorter stem is a bit closer to the side of your head, the way they fit, but then I got used to just squeezing the sides. Normally, the only bummer is there's no volume control from the buds at all. I honestly think that might be my least favorite thing about the design. I really don't want to have to ask Siri to change the volume every time hands-free. Maybe that's just me anyway. They fit into this landscape magnetic case. That, honestly, is still pretty small, it's bigger than the old air pods case, but it still easily fits in a pocket and a lot of other wireless earbuds cases have come through the studio lately and they're, consistently, typically much bigger than the air pods case. To the point where some of them aren't even really pocketable, I can still fit the air pods pro case in the tiny pocket. I never use inside the pocket in my Jean so yeah, not a problem here, but of course, the most important difference with air pods. Pro is the silicon ear tips instead of the hard plastic going into your ears turns out to be a major win for a lot of people like me, who literally can't wear regular air pods for more than about three minutes before they're. Just sliding out these actually stay in my ears. I can walk around move more than normal work out and they create a nice little seal and that's already a big functional difference. But the important thing for earbuds people is that the seal isn't uncomfortable. So typically, when you put earbuds like this into your ears, you're also pushing air into your ear too, which can be uncomfortable because it creates a bit of pressure there. But with air pods Pro the pass through cut out that lets air through equalizers pressure and by the time you're wearing them. It honestly makes it easy to forget you're wearing earbuds. Even for someone like me, who doesn't wear earbuds very often, which is impressive, so you get them in your ear. They'Re comfortable they've solved the first major problem which is staying in your ear. The next question is: how do they sound? So I have two answers: when the noise cancellation is off, they sound just like regular air, pods they're fine, when noise cancellation is on, they do sound dramatically better their pods Pro get really loud to the point where I never need them at full volume and most, If not, all the improvements in the actual sound are as a direct result of you having a decent seal now, instead of no seal at all, before, Oh for you to Quinn from snazzy labs, for an audio files perspective on exactly how air pods sound in which She describes them as mid heavy and I completely agree but I'll. Let you check out his excellent video I'll link it below. So that being said, let's talk about that noise cancellation. This is its biggest strength, so there's three modes: noise, canceling off and transparency mode, and the noise cancellation is really impressive to me with ear buds, they do well in noisy environments but they're at their best with you know, more consistent white noise. So something like the din of a coffee shop or being in a car on a road trip or even on an airplane. You know I was just thinking about it recently this because of the feature set being so unique. This is, I think, my only pair of noise-canceling open back earbuds, which is very strange, but I do love that they do noise cancellation. Now you can't control the level of noise cancellation, but it makes everything sound better and people who previously have only used. You know air pods or other headphones that don't do. This will love these. Then there is transparency mode, which I almost was equally impressed by so uses the microphones built-in to pass through audio around you, and it's this really natural sounding pass through it, with maybe a little bit of hiss, where exaggeration at the high end. But in general it sounds like you're, just not wearing anything in your ears at all, which makes it easy to forget that you're wearing them. So this is a good mode. If you're, you know walking or running next to a road or you're on a plane, waiting to hear the announcements or just generally don't want to be totally isolated from your environment. Oh and then there's a regular just on mode in the middle, which doesn't really do anything crazy with noise, cancellation or transparency. It just turns the earbuds on and saves a bit of battery this one just sounds like you're wearing ear pods with silicon tips, not amazing. Sound but you do have a little bit better of a seal than you typically would for battery overall for air pods Pro Apple says four and a half hours with noise, canceling or transparency on five hours with noise cancelling off. I kept it on all the time. I got about four hours: that's not a full flight, sometimes which is interesting, but the quick charge in the case is at least convenient. So if you do get low, you can plug in for a couple minutes and get an hour of charge out of that and they charge via lightning. So a couple of their fa. Q'S number one: do they work with Android? Yes, now they will again not be the best for Android. They lose some of the convenience features. The autoplay pause, this Siri, of course, integration, but they do work as Bluetooth earbuds. Can you use third-party custom silicon tips or replace them with foam tips that you might like better? No, as far as I know, this connection between the earbud is actually proprietary. So definitely try not to lose them because you're stuck with what comes in the box or you can go for the four dollar replacement tips straight from Apple surprisingly reasonably priced. Are they good for workouts sure I've done it? They are sweat, proof technically they're, ipx4 water-resistant, which means you can sweat on them and they survived for me. But if I was looking specifically for workout headphones, I would look more towards something like the power beats Pro, which will specifically stay in my ear better and get beat up more and be fine. But if you want just one pair of earbuds to be fine for everything, yes, these will survive will work out better than the previous air pods. So then our ear pods Pro the best wireless earbuds. Yes, but no! But yes, but no like there are headphones. That sound better this sony, WF, 1000x and threes, for example, terrible name these do sound better than the air pods. They also have better noise cancellation than air pod Pro. They also have a longer battery life in air pods Pro. They also have better customization in their app than air pods. Pro like these are technically better headphones for sure, but the air pods Pro nails so many things about everyday use like the case size for one that's a pretty dramatic difference and also as dumb as these might look. There are some other designs that are way Dumber and you do get used to the stock thing and it just ends up being natural and of course, the fast charging is convenient and the h1 chips so that it pairs instantly with any iPhone. You want and then the rest of the Apple ecosystem and a blending in with iOS 13. So well, all this stuff more than makes up for it. They'Re not audiophile grade headphones, they're, not great dedicated workout headphones they're, not the perfect headphones for flying. But if I could only pick one pair of earbuds to do all of this stuff with, I would pick air pods Pro and a lot of people are gon na make that choice there imperfectly perfect in is. Is that a word? That'S probably not a word, but you know what that's still gon na be the title. So that's been it. That'S my ear, pods Pro review, they're, really good and just for fun since y'all made it this far. If you head over to Twitter, I'm gon na be giving away a second pair of air pods, so you can check these out. I'M gon na give away this pair of D branded ear, pods Pro, of course, the headphones and the case only come in white. So you might as well get some color going and customize the case, so you know exactly which one's yours when they start showing up everywhere details will be below but yeah sometime in the next 24 hours.

DHiKz_lCYMU,Beats Solo Pro: Return to Excellence!,6:58,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm could be HD here, and these are the new beats solo Pro headphones. Hey whoa wait a second! I I thought you hate beets. What'S going on huh uh, you know what it's kind of funny the I actually kind of started off like I really loved beets, but then I sort of swung the other way and then I hated beets for a while. But then I sort of came back, but I don't know I feel like I have to check these out. Look at look at the box that come in which it says solo pros to call the pros. I have to check them out. They come at a bunch of sweet colors and then the box literally says more Matt on it as if that's a huge feature, so I I don't know I feel like I have to alright. What does that mean? I can have the Sony's then? No, no. Definitely I'm you can I'll keep using the Sony's, keep your hands off those, but these are definitely impressive to me worth. Checking out I'll show you why. So I got the blue ones, but there are a bunch of colors, including yes, matte, black everything and matte red and as a dark blue. I don't the sky blue, just a 30 guys off, but every one of these colors is a matte finish. Soft touch. All the way around, and they show absolutely no fingerprints anywhere they're just really well built. This is one of my complaints about early beats when they were just these, like thin glossy plastic bands that just broke super easily. This is basically the opposite. The top band is sturdy, now, there's actually metal in the side pieces, and I just by sliding these metal pieces up or down to the size of your head, and it's rigid like these are my favorite build of Beats headphones actually of all time, but I also Think that that biggest improvement may have also led to this headphones biggest downside, which is comfort. These are on ear headphones, first of all, and they simply don't adjusts very much like they move around a little bit, but not a whole ton like some others and they're generally, just a lot more rigid partially because of that metal and that's the number one reason They'Re uncomfortable is because they sit right on your ears and the clamp force is tight and like sometimes when the clamp force of headphones is too tight, and you know it you can sort of where you sort of break them in after a while. These haven't really had that effect, they've sort of stayed rigid, which means they're built well and they won't break, but it's still kind of uncomfortable. So I found I could wear these for a couple hours and it didn't really get worse over that time, but they'd pretty much right away, be a bit uncomfortable because they're squeezing my ears, but once you've got them on that is actually where the fun starts. They turn on automatically when you open them and they turn off actually right when you close them, which is a pretty good mechanism, there's no on/off button, so you never leave them on by accident and kill the battery and once they're on there's really just one controller And it's the d-pad on the right-hand side and it controls everything. One push for play: pause, you've got a double tap for the next track, triple tap for the previous, and you can also volume up or volume down, and then the little button on the left can turn on or off transparency mode, and the noise cancellation is pretty Good, like better than I expected, you turn it on, and you can immediately hear everything drying out. It'S great with background noise, great with public transit and awesome on a plane and the way they actually sound is good yeah. These beats sound good. It'S not like the previous solos, which have been some just super bass, heavy overwhelming garbage. These are a totally different world. I'D actually say they sound pretty fun. Now don't get me wrong, they're still heavier on the bass and the highs less on the mids, which can make it sound a little bit shrill if you're used to flatter or more neutral sounding headphones, but in general for most people. These will sound bright and clear and vivid like a photo from a samsung phone. You actually get a decent amount of isolation from the way these cups sit on your ears too, even though they're not over ear, but mainly that's because they clamp so hard so yeah. If you're still someone who's worried about beats because they might sound terrible, you don't have to worry about that anymore, but I'll still say the Sony's bows and Sennheiser premium noise cancelling headphones. I still think all sound better than these, but I mean that's pretty much it. I mean their headphones like how many features can you have the transparency mode which uses the microphones to let you hear what's around you, instead of cancelling that sound works very well and the soft case they come in, it's just that. It'S a soft case so I'll say that's fine for me, because I keep them in a backpack and a compartment by themselves, but of course, being soft. It'S not super protective. So if you're tossing it in a travel bag with some other things, be careful and then the main thing left is battery life which, on these is excellent, 40 hours with noise, cancellation off and 20 hours of listening with noise cancellation or transparency mode on. I just did a pair of cross-country flights about five hours, each average and I wore these the whole time. It was pretty uncomfortable, but I wore these the whole time and I was left with about 46 percent after all that so that about checks out. So that's great battery life and they also fast charge. So you can add up if you plug these in, I think about an hour of listening from being plugged in for five minutes. The only bummer is that they charge via lightning, which I guess, if you're an iPhone user already, is not that much of a bummer. But for someone like me who paired them with an iPad pro and an Android phone, I would have been great if they also used USB type-c like those two things, but I mean these are beats they're made by Apple. I don't even know why I get hopes up for that type of thing, but anyway I'm gon na say these are my second favorite beats ever I'm still gon na say my favorite beats. Are the power beats Pro? Those are still a kick-ass pair of workout headphones. They actually fit and stand my ears and you can run around and do all kinds of crazy stuff. So I love the power beats Pro but yeah as far as actual headphones. That beats have made there's my favorite. Yet I just wish they were more comfortable and I just keep I'm so happy that I'm pleasantly surprised with the sound for 300 bucks. These are competitive. You know there's the 250 to 400 dollar premium noise, cancelling headphone world out there, like I said, I'm still gon na switch back to my Sony's. Yes, clone I'm into the Sony's because they are more comfortable on their over ear and they sound just a little bit better, but there is no problem with these beats either way. It'S worth noting. There is a pair of over ear noise. Cancelling beats that I'm. I have to check out, but in general I'm impressed with these good job beats or good job Apple. I guess, with these I'll, be looking forward to the next pair, maybe there's a pair of wireless matte. Black beats Pro coming. That would be that'll, be kind of sick, actually either way, hey thanks for watching catch, you guys in the next one, it's tech, tech, vember, techno, tech, member. That'S that doesn't roll off the tongue as well, but it's happening catch you guys in the next one peace. """
mfbSqTB74xM,Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!,18:44,"Hey what is up guys mkbhd here? This is the pixel for excel. This is one of the phones. I was looking forward to the most this entire year for 2019 for a couple of reasons, and so now I've been using it daily since its unveiling. This is my honest review, so, let's just start with the wait, looks I honestly think it's a pretty decent. Looking phone, it's low-key, really clean, there's almost no markings along the back, just the Google G at the bottom matte black aluminum rails as part of the design. All the way around the phone speaker slots at the bottom lined up with the USB type-c port and the colored power button, of course, on every version and the whole back of the phone on two of the colors. Is this soft touch matte finish, which does a great job of not showing fingerprints? It doesn't seem to scratch very easily at all. So of the three colors available, I'm gon na say this white. This Panda version is the best one that power buttons pretty sweet. Then I'm gon na say: oh so orange is in second place, not so great power button, but at least it's matte and then that jet-black weirdly very glossy version is in third place fun. Fact, though, since the rails are still matte black, you can slap a matte black D brand skin on the back of any of these phones, and you just created the matte black everything phone Google should have made in the first place so link to that below and Of course, shout out to D brand for sponsoring this video, the pixels square camera bump is again annoyingly a little bit raised, but I don't find this as drastic as say: Apple's larger double raised, triple camera bump, but more on the cameras later so yeah. You know what generally it's grown on me, pretty decent looking phone. I was, though, let a little bit down by the not super clicky buttons, just the volume ones mainly, but on the other hand, something a lot of people have missed. That'S good to know the phone is now ip68 water-resistant. It still has the squeeze sensitivity for the assistant, and it still has stereo speakers so they're not front-facing pair, like they were last year, but they are still a good sounding solid pair with the slots at the bottom and the earpiece speaker combined the worst part about The way this phone looks is the front the part you look at most of the time, I'm not a fan of the forehead. It has a smaller chin at the bottom than before, but yeah that big forehead. I don't like it. I'M still kind of barely getting used to it and overall, the reason for the forehead doesn't really have me convinced so there's a cluster of new sensors up here in the top, including the selfie camera, then also infrared projector, receiver and radar, which is new in any Smartphone and this new sensor suite up here, is good for two things: the fastest face unlock in any smartphone and some gestures. Okay, maybe it makes me a little, not forward-thinking, but I still like fingerprint sensors and this phone has none of that. The face unlock is the only biometric unlock. This phone has - and I find myself missing a fingerprint sensor, and the rate of improvement for fingerprint sensors under the glass has been pretty good, so that move was not my favorite pixel for uses a radar sensor to essentially project a little bubble around the phone to See when things are near it when things are in the bubble want to enter it exit it etc. So, when you reach for your phone, basically your hand enters the bubble and it starts firing up the infrared and face unlock sensors early. So by the time you pick the phone up, it's already reading your face and logging you in and it's incredibly fast over and over again, it's super impressive, possibly too fast. This kind of reminds me of the 1 plus 6 and other phones that would just do face unlock with just the RGB cameras, so they'd be insanely fast. They would just see anything that looks like you and just unlock as soon as you glanced at it. So this isn't that it's still infrared, so it still can't be fooled by a photo or video of you. It still works in the dark and things like that. So it's got advantages, but it's still a little bit wild. I find myself just unlocking this phone left and right all the time anytime. I even just look at it. Sometimes I pick up the phone just to move it across my desk and I'll just glance at the time and it unlocks the phone. It also doesn't require your attention, so it will unlock with your eyes closed. That'S a that's a bit of a weird security quirk, and it actually even tells you it'll do this in the settings. When you turn this on, it says, looking at the phone can unlock it when you don't intend it to, and your device can be unlocked by someone, even if it's held up to your face. Even if your eyes are closed and potentially could be unlocked by someone who just looks a lot like you, these are things that could pretend chillie be fixed or improved with a software update and Google's been pretty good about software updates. But as of right now, they're just pretty annoying, my solution is turn off the skip lockscreen option. So if I do accidentally unlock it at least it won't be awake for a while. It just sits on the lockscreen and then it'll go back to sleep but yeah. I mean that's what I think I mean when I say I would have liked a fingerprint reader option. It'S a little safer, we're a little more used to it and it just sort of works when we need it doesn't when we don't so that's face unlock. But then these sensors also enable a couple very specific gestures. So anytime, you're in a situation you can wave over your phone and use the gesture. The status bar sort of lights up. It starts glowing, and that means it's ready. So those situations are alarm. Clocks, timers media controls and a Pikachu live wallpaper and there are no instructions like really built into Android. There'S none in the Android 10 setup, for example. Nothing really tells you what's going on when you first get that glowing bar you just kind of have to know so when an alarm or a timers going off as your hand enters that radar bubble, it quiets the alarm and then you can dismiss it by tapping Or swiping away over the phone that, for me, was my favorite. It worked really well, I can sleep with my phone on this pixel stand next to the bed and when the alarm goes off, I just reach for, and it's already quieting down. The other thing that was less consistent for me is music apps. So if you're in Spotify or Google Play Music or any supported app, where that glowing bar starts showing up, you can swipe forward and swipe back through previous and next tracks and yeah. That'S it just forward and backwards. When I first tried this at the event, I was getting a success rate of like 10 percent, I'm not even exaggerating like it was pretty abysmal. Now, with some troubleshooting and practice and some tips from Twitter I'd say I'm up to like a 70 percent swipe success rate, maybe 75. So it's less of like a big arm movement, although that sometimes does work. But it's more of like a casual swipe and not too close to the phone like right around where that radar bubble might be. I think the real problem is, it doesn't show you or tell you how to do it then made by Google Twitter account they tweeted at me saying you can go to the pixel tips, app, which is pre-installed on the pixel click save time and then click try. It and then there you will find a demo if you want to practice it, but even then there isn't. Actually I tried it. There isn't actually any feedback, it's just letting you practice. So all of that being said, I'm still not gon na use these. It sort of falls in that same gimmick bucket as the g8 weird hover hand, swiping action if it told me how to do it better, maybe I'd be more into it, but yeah not gon na use these. If there's anything to love about the front of this phone, it's the new display pixel 4 and pixel 4 XL have made the jump to smooth high res high refresh rate 90 Hertz displays my favorite trend in smartphones of the past year. So it's difficult to show you exactly how much better that looks. Obviously I keep saying on camera because this is a 30fps video. You know the correct frame rate, but in person it makes a huge difference and every time a new phone comes out with a 90 Hertz or higher display, I can see a serious difference versus 60 Hertz. It comes with some trade-offs, though it's not the brightest display. Sometimes daytime visibility is pretty weak, unfortunately, so I'm keeping this phone at max brightness, often and high refresh rate, also requires more power, so you're gon na see a hit on battery life. Now initially, I was we're all concerned about the battery life on pixel, for knowing it has a higher fresh rate and then the XL having a 3700 milliamp hour battery and the smaller pixel for having a 2800 milliamp hour battery. That'S one the smallest I've seen in a phone in a while, but impressively these phones have had for me: ok battery life, but there's a big reason for that. I was briefly messaging Dave, Toodee who's, he's testing, this smaller pixel for and he said, he's getting around. 5 hours of screen on time, which, if I take his word for it, that's actually pretty impressive. For me - I've been getting around 5 hours on this XL on 90 Hertz, which you know that's C, which is a lot better than the F. I thought it could be turns out the reason this phone has been able to get even okay battery life is because it ratchets down to 60 Hertz constantly all the time it's supposed to be smart about it. So it says when you turn on smooth display that it'll turn back down to sixty Hertz when you're not looking at it or you're, not using it much and then Ratchet it back up to 90 when you're swiping or you see animations and stuff. But I found often it just stays at 60 Hertz for extended periods of time for no apparent reason. It almost seemed like it was defaulting to 60 Hertz most of the time and then sometimes bumping up to 90 Hertz for scrolling and some other things. I started to not like it. I started to find that this phone felt significantly choppier, like any other 60 Hertz phone, then say the 1 7 Pro, which seems like it's almost always at 90 Hertz. So I was like okay, this isn't great. It'S not my favorite implementation of 90 Hertz, it smoothes sometimes, but it's almost like a tease that it switches back and forth so much so I'm like digging around in developer options just to see if there's anything new and there is. I found an option that I've never seen before. It'S called force, 90 Hertz and it just keeps the display at 90 Hertz all the time, no matter what's happening on the screen closer to what oneplus does, and it's made a huge difference. Now it's always smooth. So I guess pro tip: if you're one of those people who's more of a power user and uses their phone all the time and wants to see that 90 Hertz happen, you can go in the developer settings scroll down, find force 90 Hertz and turn it on It will obliterate your battery life, it's definitely even worse, now, closer to addy, it's not lasting all day, but at least it's smoother. Now, anyway, I also found that it has ambient EQ, which is supposed to be auto, adjusting the color temperature, depending on the light around you kind of like apples, true tone on the iPhone, but I found it much more subtle, so I just left it off. It'S not nearly as dramatic and overall it's just it's, not the flashiest or most eye-catching or dramatic display on any smartphone. It doesn't curve over the edges or anything, but it's 90 Hertz, it's 1440p! It'S OLED and it's flat. But listen. We all know what the pixel four is about, so what the pixel 3 was about and it's what the pixel 2 was about. It'S the cameras and we got some new cameras on the back of the pixel 4. There'S dual cameras back here. It'S a 12 megapixel primary camera and a new 16 megapixel 2x tell photocamera. Okay, if you told me the pixel, four would have the first second camera of any pixel phone and asked me what would be the most useless second camera they could put in the pixel right behind like a black and white depth sensor or a time-of-flight camera. I would have put like a 2x telephoto lens, just behind like an ultra-wide, clearly being way more fun or a 3 or a 5x telephoto or any of that other stuff. But that's what we got. We got 2x telephoto, but you know what specs are just one thing I got actually use it in person. That'S what I've been doing. Maybe it'll change my mind. Yeah, it didn't really change my mind. Typical photos from the pixel four are very similar to pixel. Three great dynamic range, great sharpness and detail very contrasting and punchy and dramatic and biasing a little bit towards cooler tones. Typically, if anything but they're excellent photos, they've got this image processing pipeline and their HDR down to a science and that didn't shock anyone. Thankfully, so that's good and the improvements in the viewfinder are cool. You now have real-time approximation of the HDR effect you're going to get applied before you even snap, the photo. So there's no guessing. You can pretty much just see what the final photo is. Gon na look like as you're taking it plus there's new sliders for exposure and shadow adjustment. That can be really cool and you can mess with if you want, but then having a second lens should mean portrait. Photos are better now because you have two lenses and you can finally do depth data between them. I found that they're about the same matter of fact. Some of the ones I took of Mac here look worse than any. I ever took on the pixel 3. Just look at that cut out failure. That'S pretty terrible! Maybe I shouldn't depend on pet photos for my testing of portrait mode, but I'm not exactly convinced by that, but generally on photos of people. It'S doing about the same job with that aggressive cutout and I'm speaking of portrait mode. You actually can't do wide portrait photos anymore, which the pixel 3 took some of the best wide portrait photos, but it gets even more double weird when you actually look into it. So pixel 3 took some pretty great portraits with one wide camera right when you switch to portrait mode on the pixel 4. It automatically zooms in, but not quite 2 X about point-seven or 1.8 X. But then it doesn't. Let you zoom out and take wide portrait photos like the iPhone does, but, as I'm messing with this, I realize if I cover the telephoto camera, while I'm in portrait mode, nothing happens, it's still using the main camera for portrait mode. Photos is just using the second camera for depth approximation, so why does it zoom in? I have no answer for that. So basically, the best thing about having a telephoto camera is for zoomed in photos. I don't take a lot of zoomed in photos, but I did notice them higher quality. So if you're, someone who likes to go 6 8 X, zoomed in you'll appreciate the better super resume there, you go anyway. The question still is: is this the best camera in any smartphone, because I think we can all agree? Pixel 3 was top of the stack last year, but now the field is catching up, especially iPhone 11 Pro, so which is better, ok, honestly in daylight. For most photos I prefer pixel photos. I definitely like that. Contrast II, punchy detailed, look same with wide-angle selfies punchy, detailed, I'm a fan in lower light, though I actually start to prefer iPhone photos, and I know the pixel. You know just got astrophotography capabilities that are really cool and nitesite has always been great for well over a year now, but they get a little more dramatic and, as a result, a little more noisy and iPhones new night mode and deep fusion, I think, stayed Scheuer To life and as a result, better in quality, fun fact actually did a collab. That'S live now with super staff in one of his legendary side-by-side photo comparisons. So that's the best way to see the differences between the two, so you can see iPhone 11 Pro versus pixel, 4 side-by-side and all their glory I'll leave a link below to that. So is this the best camera in any smartphone? Sometimes I'm gon na say it's a toss-up depending on the scenario and that's not a cop-out. I gave my reasons, but if I could only pick one which is sort of a different question, I would pick iPhone 11 Pro because it's more versatile it has the ultra wide and it absolutely crushes it in video like video, is just not as much of a Focus with the pickle forest camera anymore, no pun intended it tops out at 4k 30fps, which Google tweeted is because it would basically take up too much storage but then, like you, could still enabled it in. If you really cared right and that also it doesn't explain why it doesn't have 24 FPS video, which would have been a cool addition, and it also tops out at 1080p from the front-facing wide camera. So, just generally, if you're in it for video, you shouldn't be looking at pixel, you should be looking at iPhone 11 Pro my pixel vs. iPhone. Camera graph is like this pair of lines where the middle is where most photos are taken most of the time and that's where I prefer pixel, but on the edges of photography like low-light or ultra wide, then the iPhone does better so there. Hopefully, that explanation makes sense, and then you can't forget Android 10, which gets the special treatment on the pixel since it's Google's baby. There are some good features here that add to how smart it is as a smart phone. You already heard about the radar bubble and the smart unlock features. They move the text-to-speech offline local on the phone, so text-to-speech is way faster and way more consistent. I love that you can talk as fast as you want and it just works and there's a new voice recorder, app that takes advantage of that to live transcribe everything you say and then index is that text to make it searchable. That'S like an S Pen level feature. I personally probably won't use it too much, but I can see how people who use that would find it a really big deal but yeah. The best part of a pixel again is how refined Android is. If you want the latest version of Android, if you want to be first with updates, if you want the coolest edge features and the assistant and all that is the phone again so overall, many of the conclusions about pixel 4 are, of course, about how disappointing it Is which i think is an easy conclusion to reach if you've followed all the leaks and nothing really surprised you and are things that are let down. I personally really enjoyed using pixel because of the punchy, confident, excellent camera for still photos and the 90 Hertz display, which a lot of phones don't have yet and of course, the extra RAM. Finally, a smooth pixel phone, but this isn't a phone. I'M gon na go around recommending to everyone. It still needs a bigger battery still needs more storage and it's just generally not complete for most people. So I guess, if you're like me, which is in a tiny group of people who really like high refresh rate screens of course, value the camera and want the latest version of Android. And these clicked up to. And things like that and you're willing to overpay. Because we all know the pixel is a bit overpriced for the storage. You don't get then sure I recommend the pixel it's great for people like that, but for most people, I'm not gon na end up recommending the pixel for mainly because of the battery, but also because there are just better deals out there right now, including the cheaper Iphone 11, weird to say, but it kind of hits the ear funny, but it's true. So there you have it the pixel for possibly a victim of the hype, machine of being the most leaked phone of all time. I kind of wouldn't be surprised if it happens again next year, but either way now you know what it's like to own it and I'm curious. Are you in this tiny group of people who would like this pixel experience? Let me know either way thanks for watching catch, you guys in the next one peace """
zsEcLVHnxUM,OnePlus 7T Pro: Tiny Tweaks to Excellence!,6:37,"Sup guys and PhD here so we're approaching the end of the year, but it's still tech, Tober and one of my favorite phones of this year 2019 was the oneplus 7 pro. So I guess oneplus felt the need to update their lineup right for the holiday season. So they did and our newest phone is this: the oneplus 7t pro now a lot of you guys have been asking me how I feel about this phone. It might be the smallest incremental update from phone to phone that I've ever seen. So if I put these phones right next to each other, you might not know which one is which on the left is the 1 7 Pro and on. The right is a 1 plus 70 Pro. But if you couldn't tell just by that glance, allow me to show you all of the differences. So on the back, we have a slightly new color, it's still blue, but instead of nebula blue, it's what they call haze blue. You know it's a little bit lighter honestly. I like it a little bit less, it's a bit fingerprint tea and it's also less matte but hey at least now. You know which one is which this is haze, blue and you can see the oneplus 70 Pro has a laser autofocus cut out next to the camera module, which looks like an addition, but that may just be a bit of a psychological trick, because the 7 Pro Already had a laser autofocus module built into the camera module in between the cameras there, so this isn't a new sensor or anything they just moved it to the outside of the module. And now it looks like a new one anyway, then, on the inside you're. Looking at snapdragon, 855 8 gigabytes of ram and 256 as the only speck, so there's no 12 gig option in the regular one 70 Pro anymore, but the new processor is a little bump and then the battery situation technically also got an upgrade you're. Now, looking at a very slightly larger 4000 85 milliamp hour battery and that's coming from the four thousand milliamp hour battery, we already had in the oneplus 7 pro. Do we even count that as an upgrade technically yeah, I mean it's not smaller, so I guess we should be happy about that, but yeah slightly just very slightly larger sure. The real upgrade here is the slightly faster warp charge, 30 T and package. That'S the same size, so the charger comes in the box. It supports 23 % faster charging because of the new battery tech, it's already an extremely fast charger. I do appreciate that cameras. I I'd say same triple cameras, I believe the exact same three sensors, but with the added macro mode, which is a hardware adjustment, they added a little motor to the main camera that lets you get super super close for minimum focus, distance in a macro mode. Same thing we saw on the 70, it's pretty cool lets. You get super close to subjects if you're into macro photography on your phone and that's it. That'S all that's new for the 70 pro the rest in case, you forgot, is basically the same as they already excellent. 7. Pro same 6, point 6, 7 inch. 1440P 90 hertz oled notch list display one my favorites of the year same pop up camera mechanism. To achieve that, Nautilus design same super fast, ufs, 3.0 storage - these are all pretty much things i loved about that 1 plus 7. Pro the thing I dislike the most was the curved edges on the screen, but I'm not shocked that they didn't change that yet I'll hold out hope for next version. So there's no all new cameras to bring it up to compete with the pixel. There'S no 5g version, there's no wireless charging, there's no major features added to the 7 T Pro. It'S just basically a little bit of a tweak to their already great phone to bring it up to the end of 2019 standards. Tech moves fast. I get it. So that's this is the latest and greatest. If you already have their latest phone. Obviously you don't have to upgrade, but this is their greatest available option, but of course we can't forget to include the McLaren Edition that they also introduced next to it. So this is the oneplus 70 Pro McLaren Edition a pretty long name with a bit of a different design for a hundred extra bucks. This is going to be your dramatic dark forged carbon fiber, looking design and papaya orange accents that McLaren is famous, for. I think it looks pretty badass, but it's also a huge fingerprint magnet with this glossy finish. So I kind of wish it was sort of a hybrid of like a frosted glass version of this may be a little more matte to get this, this crazy carbon fiber. Look to through, but not attract finger prints, but just the way it is. It really catches the light a certain way and you can see more and more of the carbon pattern under the glass very cool, and I think people who appreciate supercars will really appreciate this. One and the McLaren Edition is available with 12 gigs of RAM, so that is the only spec difference if you're looking for a reason for the McLaren Edition to be faster, which they've done in the past, that's the only thing 12 gigs of ram on the McLaren Edition eight gigs of RAM on the regular phone, that's it so they have it. You know you guys wanted me to cover it, and now we have our hands on it and it's like I said, maybe the smallest upgrade I've ever seen in a phone which I guess makes sense with the t version, a phone that came out just eight months Ago, of course, the point is it's a slight upgrade from what was already the fastest phone I've ever used and was one of my favorites. So you know a little tweaks here and there just increase the lead a little bit on one of the best smartphone experiences of 2019. For me with this new one, the strangest thing about this phone might be their decision not to bring it to North America. They'Re not selling it in the US they're not continuing their push with higher priced phones in this expensive market, putting in carrier stores and things like that, they chose not to do that with this phone, so special thanks to South from super staff TV. He is the only reason I got to check out these phones. He brought them over here with him, so I'm gon na have to give it right back to him big shout-out to super staff I'll have a link to his channel below. So I guess I'm not mad. You know I already have a 1 7 Pro it's in the u.s.. It'S basically the same thing and I can live without the slightly faster charging and the new chip and macro mode. I guess I'll live with that, but, as hope to Franco would say, I'm gon na pass the question off to you. Have you ever seen a one to one upgrade this small in smartphones before you don't have to answer that? It'S probably no. I guess basically oneplus wanted to have something available right around October October for the holiday season. They got it out. You can get it in certain markets. If you don't, you can get a one plus seven Pro, that's mainly the gist there you have it. I'Ve covered it we're out here. Tech tober rolls on thanks for watching this.

5TuyvWoaAZk,Apple Watch Series 5 Review: One Big Tradeoff!,7:38,"What'S up guys mkbhd here, I bet I'm not the only one to speak to the CEO of Microsoft while wearing an Apple watch, and I bet I'm not the only one to chat with Bill Gates with an Apple watch on, and I bet he's also probably noticed, Though it's not that I'm trolling nobody doing, that is trolling, it's just that it's the default! At this point, the Apple watch is everywhere, it's the default SmartWatch for the iPhone, which is also everywhere. So after a couple of my tweets, some of you guys wanted to know my full thoughts on Apple watch Series 5, the latest and greatest version of it that just came out for this holiday season. Spoiler alert i've already tweeted most of my thoughts, but i'll put them all in one video here in one place, so I have the 44 millimeter instead of the 44, that bigger face bigger battery, even though I don't have a huge wrist, I think it looks just Fine and I went with Space Gray aluminum, so I keep that dark. Matte finish and I've had no durability issues on my other aluminum Apple watches and yes, just to get it out the way I do wear it on my right wrist, even though I'm a righty, I guess I'm just backwards like that. So if you remember that Apple event, just a couple weeks ago, there weren't really all that many new features with the new Apple watch. You know there's a new brushed, titanium finish that looks really cool and there's also the other ceramics and stainless steel, and things like that and there's some other new features and some new bands, but really the main new feature of Apple watch. Series 5 is the always-on display. So technically speaking, this new Apple watch is able to maintain the always-on display with a new display technology that keeps it lit up dimly but lit up all the time at a variable refresh rate. So it's called LTP o, which stands for low temperature, poly-silicon and oxide, which doesn't really matter as much as just knowing that this involves a special controller and certain hardware. That'S only in Apple watch Series 5. So there can't be a software update to make the series 3 or series 4 do always-on, it's just in series 5. So the display itself it'll, look just as good and it'll get just as bright, and it's just a familiar OLED you're used to looking at. But now it's always on so tip when you're, using an Apple watch, the OLED refreshes at 60 frames per second for 60 Hertz! That'S why animations are smooth everything, looks normal and a second hand. If you have one on your clock, face sort of smoothly rolls around in a circle. This is still the case here with this new version, but when you stop using it or you put it down, it goes into always-on mode, the display dims and it ratchets down to refresh as low as one Hertz or one time every second, which is fine because It hides the second hand and it doesn't have to show you constantly refreshing information and things smoothly on the screen, so it can still show you the time all the time and save a ton of power by not still refreshing at 60 Hertz. So, okay, what are the benefits of this always-on display? You may ask if you've never used any other SmartWatch well, if you've had an Apple watch before then you're already used to this gesture, you have to do to get it to recognize that you're looking at it and to light up whatever your latest notification is or Just see the time, sometimes you can get pretty good at it doing it subtly, but it's a pretty obvious gesture. But of course, sometimes it's just kind of hard or just straight-up inconvenient. To do that whole gesture and you just want to be able to glance over at it and see the time or just check something real, quick without the whole obvious wrist movement, maybe you're, driving or riding a bike and don't want to switch to one hand or Maybe you're typing and you just want to look down and glance at the time without stopping or maybe you're in just a social situation or it'd be kind of rude to check the time with the huge sweeping gesture. So these are all real situations, and that is why people wanted always on just the glance ability, but the most controversial trade off here with always-on is battery life, so Apple claims that the variable refresh rate is what will help you not obliterate your battery life. It'S going down to this way, low-power mode and it's true, it doesn't completely crush your battery, but I have definitely noticed that having the OS on display always-on does hurt your battery life. I personally went from ending the day with 50 something percent left to ending a normal day with 20 to 30 % left and that's not the end of the world. That'S definitely still clearly all-day battery life. For my usage, which is high, brightness, getting plenty of notifications, frequent workouts things like that, but I did still notice that hid and on a day with a longer outdoor workout, where it's using GPS and it's just always on you - can actually get close to killing the Apple watch in a day which I never did before always on, and I did some more on-and-off testing with this, and some of you were actually skeptical about it. When I tweeted about it saying it was the noise app in the background or some other things was software that I should check out, but I don't need any more proof than the fact that when I turned it off, I was getting to noon with 90 plus Percent battery life left, which is incredible, and that's that's legitimately 2-day battery life that I wasn't getting when I turned always-on back on. So that's something I've noticed at this point. I kind of just turned it on when I want to and then turn it off. When I know I'm gon na be having a longer day, it's only a quick couple taps away in the settings i switched wrists. Sometimes so i'm used to diving in the settings to change the wrist orientation. So I just do that often I'll just turn. Always-On off sometimes so, if I'm out at night I'll, usually turn it off, because it's slightly annoying to be the guy with the glowing wrist all night, but in a normal day at work during the day I'll leave it on it's a balancing act. It'S a little more thinking than I had to do before, but it's also a feature I've never had before. So I guess I'm willing to do that. Some other small thoughts, the compass built-in now is pretty sweet. I will literally never use the compass app, but it is cool that it's more accurate to tell you what direction you're facing when you're using maps and the noise app is also kind of cool. You can add a complication to your watch, face or just use the app to monitor noise levels and it'll. Tell you when the environment you're in has potentially damaging levels of noise and just a thought about the blob, app chooser interface. I just got to say I think this might be the worst UI in any Apple product in any tech product in like the last decade. I think we can all agree on that. I'Ve changed it to list mode, maybe uh, maybe figure out a grid mode or something for picking apps on the watch Apple just saying, but overall honestly, it's it's kind of similar to that iPhone 11 review. Where, like it's, an Apple watch like you already know what it does, it's the same design, some subtle, tweaks and really one main new feature. I think the fact that I've disabled the O is on display so often is kind of hilarious like if you would disable it. If you wouldn't use the always-on stuff very often, then this is about as good as this series, 3 or series 4, in which case you can pick one of those up from Apple or on Amazon, for a pretty steep discount, so I'll link those below that's a Better deal but other than that I just kind of like the way the Apple watch has been: it's not a necessary upgrade, but for the stuff I usually do, which is having the great display telling a time. Workouts notifications, that's just basically it I mean anything extra as a bonus Apple watch continues to firmly deliver on all the things you expect it to and if you've always wanted always-on, then this is the Apple watch to get, but anyway, that's about it quick review. But if you want the next stuff, it's coming up, quick, its tech, Tober, there's a lot happening. I'Ve got you guys, the next one peace """
OoY7zp8GkLI,iPhone 11 Review: Too Easy!,8:10,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here, and this is the iPhone 11. So it's a solid improvement over the iPhone 10 are in a couple ways: it's a bit cheaper than the pros. Now it's got a price drop, so this is the new iPhone that most people should buy. That was easy to easy, actually that this everything about this phone is so easy, like it's gon na, be super easy to review, because there's so few things, but such obvious things that are different from the 10r and, of course this is a super easy phone for Apple to make - and so this is a super easy phone to recommend. Maybe this is the easiest video I've ever had to make, but probably not, let's just get into it. So the design is very familiar with this one, because it's the same as the 10 R and the 10s and the 10 same shape same notch same size as the 10 R. It'S still a pretty big phone, the same mute switch same speakers same aluminum rails. The same lightning port same LCD display with the 1792 by 8:28 resolution that has us all questioning a lot of things like not being able to watch HD YouTube videos on a $ 700 phone, but hey people, oven, reviewers, didn't seem to mind a lot. Last year. Same water, resistance, same ip68 same buttons, you get the idea, so, okay, what is new? First of all the name so they're calling it just iPhone 11. So it's the de-facto standard name now, and that also means they're dropping the Roman numerals, which is also probably fine, because we all know a couple people that just called it the ex over and over that's okay and the iPhone 11 has six new colors. So black green, yellow, purple, red and white and they're all more pastel II, so at the product red this year, is a little lighter than the product red from last year. I personally liked the color choices of last year's 10 are more. Actually, I think the blue is pretty nice. The coral was really unique, but those are all gone now, but I guess there's still a little bit of something for everyone. If you are looking to get a little closer to that stealth, midnight green look but don't want to spend the money on the 11pro. You could always grab a darker skin from our channel sponsor, debrand and boom. You got yourself a stealthy new iphone for $ 715. Instead of a thousand, i will of course, always drop a link right below that like button, but if you rock your phone naked like me, you will notice. There are two different glass finishes on the back of the iPhone 11 there's glossy like normal across the back, where the Apple logo is now in the middle instead of slightly north of the middle. But the camera square is actually a matte glass finish now, so the opposite of the 11pro, which did a matte phone and a glossy camera square, and you might already known that. But what you might not know is that they're all cut from one piece of glass. That'S milled down to cut the shape out of it and then two different finishes. So that's pretty cool, no matter what you think of the shape and then we'll get to. Of course, these cameras in a second but the size and the thickness and weight are exactly the same as the 10r, so it's still 8.3 millimeters thick still 194 grams according to Apple site. But you do now have a battery life that, according to Apple, is one hour longer than the iPhone 10 are. Now again. I don't measure battery the same way. Apple does, but the iPhone 10 are already had some of the best battery life in any iPhone. In a really long time - and it was the reason that a lot of people who got it - kept it and switched to it, so I can confirm that the 11 has at least equivalent battery life to the 10r, as it should now that it has a more Efficient a 13 Bionic, so then the only other thing that's new is the cameras, and this is easily the biggest new thing about these. So there's a new main camera and they'd added a second camera to the iPhone 11 and it's the ultra wide. So you now get dual cameras and all the awesome features that come with it like switching between lenses, while recording video. So you get 4k video from the regular and from the ultra wide camera, iPhone 11 dose portrait mode now with more than just human faces. So it doesn't have to detect a face to do the fake, shallow depth of field with animals and objects and other things like that and there's also a new wider front-facing camera that can take slow, slow motion, videos. It can take it slow motion, selfie videos, if you want to huh. So the only thing that's missing is you don't get the third telephoto camera from the iPhone 11 pro? That'S not a huge deal to me and both of these two new included cameras are excellent. They'Re, a plus smartphone cameras in 2019. I do go into more detail on the photo and video quality in the iPhone 11 Pro review for these new cameras. So if you want to check that out I'll link it below but suffice to say, this is the best camera in a $ 700 smartphone debatably, arguably the best in any smartphone, but I still think it's sort of a toss-up with the pixel 3. But then again, this has the ultra wide camera that the pixel 3 doesn't, but also the pixel 4, depending on when you watch. This is right around the corner, so we get to the full camera comparison when they all come out. But for now, if you want a great camera, this is a great camera and then they changed the price they dropped. The price so iPhone 11 now starts that, and this is for 64 gigs, and I think most people or a lot of people should upgrade from that, but it starts at 700 bucks now which sort of fits nicely in this gradient of iPhone prices. That Apple has created now that they've kept around the 10r from last year for cheaper and the iPhone 8 for even cheaper, and that is pretty much everything you need to know. That'S new with this iPhone 11 easy iPhone 11 is an iPhone. 10 are with a slightly new design, new cameras with an extra camera on the back, a slightly better battery and a new chip as it now. The question is: do you recommend it and I think the easy answer is yeah. This is the iPhone that most people should get, but for a little more nuance, I think you should really ask yourself two questions one. How much do you really care about the quality of this screen? The biggest weakness of this phone is definitely still the display and again a lot of people won't even notice and the YouTube app. I noticed even lies to you and lets you pick 1080p as if you're watching a 1080p video but you're, not it's like. I said just over 720p, so if you look at the iPhone 10 hour display or if you look at this iPhone 11 in a store - and you can tell it's not sharp or you really value a great display - and you know it I'd say pick one of The pie resolution OLED, I phones the 10s or the 11 Pro and then the other number two is just the size. How do you feel about the size of this phone? I actually really liked that the iPhone 11 pro is a relatively compact smart phone by today. Standards anyway, so if you look at like the 6.1 inch screen size and it's actually too big, if you've handled an iPhone 11 or 10 R, then you could go for the slightly smaller, better display in the iPhone 11 Pro which will cost you more. But it's smaller or if you think it's not big enough, you can go for the bigger iPhone 11 Pro Maxx, oh and there's another one actually, which is just all you want to budget, which just generally will put a lot of people in the camp of buying The cheaper iPhone but combo breaker, they are still selling iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 are, and I think, iPhone 10 are at 600. Bucks is more competitive if you don't care about the second camera or the camera upgrade small group of people, but if you have to get an iPhone, that's one to consider, but that is pretty much it they did it. They made an iPhone 11. That'S easy to recommend and it's the new iPhone that people buying a new iPhone should probably just get. But that's what happens when you make some improvements on one of your most popular products and drop the price a bit and rename it to just the de-facto iPhone. But I also can't let you forget: the weight of the 20/20 iPhone is heavy on the horizon and it's definitely too early to get excited for that it's another year away for that phone, but that's where I'm looking either way. Thanks for watching this super easy, video and I'll catch, you guys in the next one peace, """
XRiUNPf-_-4,"OnePlus 7T Review: High Refresh, Low Price!",10:05,"What'S up guys mkbhd here - and this is the 1 plus 70, so if you followed the leaks, take a a promo you've, probably seen pretty much every angle of this thing, but now it's officially been unveiled. I'Ve been using it daily for about a week, and this is a pretty easy phone to explain so, one plus the company. They have they're sort of upper mid-range phones somewhere around five hundred six hundred dollars like one plus seven, then they have their premium high-end flagship. Stuff, like one plus seven pro, that's closer to seven eight hundred bucks, so this phone, the one plus seventy kind of kind of a hard name to say out loud: it's not the seventy, but it's the one plus seventy. This phone is sort of a Frankenstein between those two groups: it's right between the super high end and the upper mid-range. If that makes any sense, so to be perfectly clear, it is a really great phone for the price, which is basically the oneplus special. At this point, they've continued this fascinating slow creep up in price, but when you go over this phone and everything they've combined in here, it's pretty on point for what you're getting for $ 599.95 combination of things, despite not being the highest end display. You know it gets pretty bright up to a thousand knits, so outdoor visibility is no problem and the teardrop not being a little smaller makes it super easy to ignore on this gigantic screen. But it's also 1080p not 1440, and the bezels are just a little bit. Thicker, a tiny a bit as you can see - and I have noticed some real off-axis, color, tint and rain bowing and other consistencies like that that you'll notice on not so high-end OLED displays. So it's not the super best of the best. But it's like right underneath. It'S right in between it's making sense right, they're, bringing things down from the higher end phone that makes sense, while keeping the sort of baseline of the mid-range. The high refresh rate, I think, is the most important thing that they brought down that I just I love me. Some 90 Hertz, some high refresh rate goodness so that's good to see, and then just the design of this phone in general is also a bit of a Frankenstein. You'Ve, probably noticed it by now. There'S this or a blue color again, although this time it's not as matte as before, it's kind of closer to like a satin, because it has more of a sheen to it. It'S not really glossy, like some other phones, but you definitely do still see fingerprints. Much more than a matte phone, so it's somewhere in between again the 7 pro is more matte than this one. But here's some other improvements you do have. The alert slider is tighter. So it's it's more satisfying to move between the three positions. So that's pretty sweet. They brought down the high-end, really precise, haptic motor - that's honestly only really matched on Android by the pixel at this point, so that was great and they brought the optical fingerprint reader underneath the glass that's also the same sensor as the one from the 7 Pro, and I think one of the best in any phone under the glass right now. The speakers are also just as good as a 7 throat. They sound loud and full and there's also a bigger speaker, grow up at the top, and charging is now even faster, so they're calling it warp charge 30 T it's still a 30 watt fast charger, but thanks to improved battery chemistry in the 3800 milliamp hour battery. In this phone it'll charge 23 % faster, then warp charge 30 already did so. In other words, it's silly fast and it's kind of a you know a different philosophy on battery management. On one hand, I love, you know the little chunkier phones that'll. Have this massive battery inside and all-day battery life? It changes the way I use phones. I didn't worry about charging ever during the day, but on the other hand, a phone. That'S really trim like this. That has crazy fast charging just lets. You have this peace of mind at any time, you're starting to get low. You can just plug in for a couple minutes and be right back up to set 80 %. So it's like a different kind of confidence in the battery. I don't really have a preference between the two. It would be great to have both, but as of right now I like having this we're charged 30 t. They say we'll get you to 70 % from dead in half an hour and that's awesome, and I believe that. But I'm even more impressed by just how much you can add from plugging in for five minutes ten minutes and just giving you a massive boost for the rest of the day, so the seventy does have decent battery life. But this is the steady compromise they make for not having the best battery life and then, of course, the gigantic camera circle. On the back, it's genuinely, I think, the first design from oneplus that doesn't feel to me like really sleek or clean, like they've done triple cameras before even but this one is very different. It kind of reminds me of somewhere between Motorola or the red hydrogen, or you might even remember the Nokia Lumia series back in the day. So anything is. These are essentially the same exact cameras that the oneplus 7 pro already has same standard 48 megapixel standard camera. Same 117 degree ultra wide and then a shorter 2x telephoto zoom camera instead of a 3x. So if you're actually looking for some big camera improvements for the 70, that is not what's happening here and it's actually not like the 1 plus 7 pro camera was bad. It'S just that it was the one part of the phone that wasn't. You know best-in-class world class, it sort of held it back from being an arguably perfect phone in a way, but in a $ 600 phone in 2019. This set of cameras is perfectly good. I'Ve been taking photos and videos with it just to see if I notice any substantial differences around, but there isn't anything too drastic, still very solid and daylight, and a bit color fringy and soft around the edges with close up subjects and passable, but not amazing shots In less than ideal lighting, if you think about other cameras in this six hundred dollar price range, that's about right, actually right up until they start to get blown out the water by the $ 700 iPhone 11. You can take portrait mode shots now in telephoto or standard cameras now, which is cool, and they are also enabling 4k 30fps video from the ultra wide camera. So they've heard our feedback, they are going to do that and I think them impressive improvement here is the new super macro mode. So you hit this little flower icon in the top corner and you can get way up close to things to point five to eight centimeters away from the camera lens, which most smartphones do struggle with. If they don't have a macro mode, and so with this, I was able to take some close-ups that I couldn't even get with the iPhone 11 and then, of course, this wouldn't be a new one plus phone without really killer high-end, on paper specs. And so that's what they've done here again so Snapdragon a 55 plus the newest chip, eight gigs of ram not 12 and 128 or 256 gigs of ufs, 3.0 storage, so yeah! This thing is fast and it's running the latest version of oxygen OS 10. On top of Android 10, which I think makes this the first non pixel Android 10 phone, I've used and it's been really good so far. I obviously love that they're early, 2 updates and performance has actually been really smooth. You may have noticed, I didn't keep the Android 10 gestures. The swipe gestures turned on here's. Why Android 10 gestures on this phone are a swipe up from the bottom for home 1/2 swipe up for multitasking and then a swipe in from the lower side to go back from anywhere? You know what else uses that swipe to go back on the side? A lot of Android apps for other things, Twitter to switch between accounts, flamingo for Twitter, tick, tick, my tasks, app YouTube studio. Google Photos the Play Store. I mean a lot of Google apps use that hamburger menu and the screen is so big on this phone that I don't really want to reach up to the corner with one hand to press the hamburger menu every single time. So I don't so. I turned it off and I just keep using the buttons for now, but aside from that, Android 10 has been really nice really smooth, as you'd expect on a new phone with a 90 Hertz screen and all the optimizations oneplus is continually working on for oxygen OS. They really show so all that for me, using this phone has added up to it being a pretty solid set of trade-offs that add up to a pretty good phone for a pretty great price. It really feels like they're taking the stuff that they learned how to do better and more efficiently from the 7 Pro and bringing it down to a more competitive price, which is a great way of sell. A lot of phones now for to be perfectly clear. The oneplus 7 pro is still a better phone than this. Just because of this small bit of trade-offs, they've kept a higher quality display higher resolution, not as much color fringing and things like that. Bigger battery less ugly camera bump on the back and the knotch less screen on the front, so all of that sort of adds up to a little bit of trade-offs here. But overall, this is that incremental update. You expect from a t phone from oneplus with the X Factor of that 90 Hertz display that is so hard to switch back from. So that's the statement that the phone leaves me with is that I'm glad that oneplus is doubling down on the high refresh rate stuff to really make phones feel smooth high refresh rate, all the things please. This is gon na, be a really good buy for people who want to spend like 600 bucks on a phone. But for me, I'm personally going to be pretty excited about the 1 7 T. Pro names are getting weird, but that's the phone that's gon na have the best of the best that I'm looking forward to, but yeah, not bad I'll, have a link below. If you want to check it out, that's been it. Thank you for watching, and I catch you guys. The next one. Peace """
DyX-QZZBgpw,iPhone 11 Pro Review: For the Love of Cameras!,15:43,"Welcome to the review of the iPhone 11 Pro right off the bat. I don't really agree with the names. I don't think there's enough pro about these phones that could have been to warrant putting pro in the name, but the names don't really matter. What does matter is these are the highest end. Phones that Apple makes right now in 2019. The truth is these are mostly pretty familiar phones to last year, which was also pretty familiar to the year before, but you already knew that what's new is Apple's really focused on four major things for this new iPhone, so the design, barely the new display slight upgrade The battery life major and these new cameras, so the design does grow on you not gon na lie. We saw those renders and the models, and nobody thought they were pretty, including me, but as usual, getting them in your hand and actually looking at them in person is a different thing and it doesn't look horrible. I love the new matte finish. I think that helps a lot the way it looks the way it feels, even if it is technically a little bit slippery than glossy, I will take a matte option in any phone every time. The camera square is a weird looking part, I'm just happy. We got memes out of it and it's funny, for whatever reason the camera square looks indented, even though it's sticking out it's all cut from one piece of glass and it's kind of like this weird optical illusion. I guess, but this is the design that Apple is crafted for the iPhone 11 pro camera bumps in a camera square, and yes, it rocks slightly when it's on a table. Apple does say that this is quote the toughest glass in any smartphone. I'M not gon na test that, but let's be real, glass is glass, so you definitely want to protect it or at least try not to drop it. It probably still will shatter, but the good news is, it doesn't seem to scratch as much as the pixel 3 is a matte black glass that this reminded me of so the matte finish, and the camera layout are the only really new things back here with the Design, if it comes down to it, if you don't want to have to think about it anymore or just want to avoid any chance of fingerprints or scratches, you can grab a grip from our channel sponsor D brand and this matte black robot skin on. It is actually a limited edition thing so link below if you want to check that out, but around the front of the phone. It'S gon na look like almost exactly the same thing as last year. Same screen, sizes and resolutions same notch same bezels literally, you could put it next to lasya stone and you might have a hard time telling which ones which this is the new one here. So this is, what's actually different. Apples said they've improved face ID to be up to 30 % faster in the same space and work at a larger variety of angles. I can vouch for a tiny bit faster and you'll only really notice this, if they're side by side with the old phone. But you know what I'll take that improvement anyway, because it's for security and that's better than nothing, but the variety of angles thing I don't know about you, but when I read that I was hoping that meant it could sit on a table in front of you And still read and unlock your face like it couldn't before, but it still doesn't do that. Unfortunately, you still got to do that lean onto whatever service the phone is on to unlock it. So I've noticed honestly no improvement here in the angles. That'S basically the same. Oh than that, the buttons are very, very slightly lower on each phone. I don't know if anyone else has shown that, but that's true, I guess maybe it's a little easier to reach and they've also upgraded the water resistance, a bit. It'S still IP 68 certified and this phone is very slightly thicker and heavier. I didn't really notice the thickness, but I did notice the weight, especially in the Promax. This big phone is 20 grams heavier than last year, and I could tell it's a bit of a chunker, but you know what that's perfectly fine, because battery life is back to being excellent on this phone as a result, this is also achieved by getting rid of 3D touch so r.i.p Apple watch is really the only new Apple product now, with 3d touch shipping in it. But by getting rid of that pressure-sensitive display hardware, that's allowed more space in the phone for a bigger battery. It'S true, the tear downs have shown it. The battery is bigger, so that's why the battery difference from the 10 R to the 11 was one hour. That'S just a 13 Bionic improvements, but the improvement from the 10 s to the 11. Pro was four hours, because getting rid of that 3d touch. Hardware has left room for more bigger batteries. I don't know if I can measure that four to five hour claim, but from my experience battery life has been excellent. I'M getting you know my use of super high brightness high-end, everything on all the time, I'm getting seven to eight hours of screen on time and full day of battery pretty much every day on this phone. So that's really impressive. You can probably kill it in a day, but you'd have to really try now back to that display for a second I mentioned they got rid of 3d touch. This has been mostly replaced by haptic touch, which is essentially long presses that bring back almost all the functionality from 3d pressing, it's not quite as good as the peak and pop was, but I hardly use that anyway and there's also something new about the display, specifically That it can hold a higher 800 nits of brightness and at small points for brief moments, can peak up to 1200 nits, which is incredible on a smartphone display, and also it's up to a two million to one contrast ratio. So, of course, they had to name it. They named it. The super Retina display XD are, the name is pretty lame, but the display is impressive again indoors and outdoors now, could you tell the difference side-by-side with a 10s watching a YouTube, video or playing a game or even scrolling Instagram? Probably not, but there are certain times certain times when watching a movie or something in HDR, where you cannotice, that improved brightness and it looks great and the sound is also pretty good. Thanks to the improved speakers, even though there is still a notch, you know the highest end. Iphone display has always been pretty great, and this is no exception. It'S better again, but I can't help but think what would customers have noticed more, a slightly improved, brightness or shrinking the notch, a bunch. You know that's something we'll get more into later. For now, what you need to know is the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Maxx have even better awesome. High resolution. Oled displays again and they're also a bit more efficient, contributing to even more battery gains. So that's worth it oh and the specs. They almost don't matter on an iPhone review, but since people are always curious, it is the new a 13 Bionic chip this year, which is excellent and four gigs of ram in these pro phones. According to Geekbench, it's still extremely fast, as any new phone should be. Most of these improvements over the a12 are just gon na help. These stay faster for longer and, as it's been said, they'll be appreciated more near the end of the phone's life than the beginning. All right, I almost can't believe I made you guys, wait this long for the cameras. So clearly the cameras are if you've watched any of the ads or any of the presentation. Videos. These cameras are the main focus for the iPhone 11 Pro. Yes, that's a pun. So you've seen it we're looking at triple cameras now three new sensors, so you have the primary 12 megapixel sensor, a 2x telephoto camera and a 0.5 X ultra wide camera about a 120 degree field of view and it's true. The iPhone 11s cameras are a big improvement over the 10s in broad daylight. I would go as far as saying this has been an A camera, often taking the best, sharpest and cleanest photos. I'Ve seen a smartphone take colors are great they're, realistic, so not to over processed dynamic range is excellent and, of course, with subjects their tonal mapping is next-level. It'S really good, which helps it, of course, in tougher shooting scenarios where it's improved a lot over the tennis. So the typical iPhone 11 pro photo is, I think, the closest to what the human eye sees of any smartphone camera and I'm, including the pixel on that which tends to be a little contrast here, a little more dramatic, but then, of course, the ultra wide camera. Finally, I've been waiting for this. I'Ve been waiting to see what an iPhone ultra wide camera would look like. Lg done it Samsung, did it motorola? Did it Asus, did it one plus? Did it Huawei did it? Everyone had already done in ultra wide. We just wanted to see basically what Google and Apple would do with their new cameras, so we finally have an iPhone ultra wide and it's uh, it's fine. It'S pretty good. It'S actually really fun. The main advantage should be consistency with the other lenses and color wise white balance wise. It is it's very consistent, but in quality and detail thanks to the smaller sensor and slower glass, it is still noticeably a step down. It'S softer, there's a little more noise reduction. Doing more smoothing on the ultra wide camera, so it's just generally not as good quality as the main camera, which is to be expected. But that doesn't stop it from being awesome to have for these new fun perspectives and all the awesomeness that comes with an ultra wide camera. The new UI, also in iPhones camera app, is improved for the first time in a while. You know they simplified a few controls brought them to the bottom, where you can reach in with one hand, and now, when you open it, you get a preview of what's gon na show up in the ultra wide if you switch to it. But I I don't really want that there, I think it's kind of cool, that it shows what you could see, but when I just want to take a normal photo, it's kind of distracting it lags behind a little, the actual framing and it's not perfectly aligned all The time so I want to turn it off, but I can't it will fade out automatically when it detects that you're taking a photo of a close-up subject. Since I guess it recognizes that ultra wise are more for landscapes or faraway subjects and then it'll come back automatically when you put that close subject away but yeah, I want to be able to just shut it completely off haha, there's also now. Finally, a dedicated night mode which turns on automatically when it thinks it's dark enough, but sometimes it's kind of dim and it doesn't turn on when you want it to. But there's no way to manually turn on night mode, which isn't very Pro. But ok, when you do get it turned on, the UI is excellent. It gives you exposure equivalents, so you can turn up or down live and it will go for way longer times if it detects you're on a tripod or stabilized, and you can see the picture sort of brighten up as it's being taken almost like. It'S exposing the frame in real time, which is pretty sick and the shots you can get now at night and in low-light on the iPhone are very good. There'S no clear overall winner, I think for best night mode right now. In my opinion, they all sort of do it a different way. Here'S my take night mode is good enough that I wish I could turn it on more often, I think the natural curious comparison here is with pixels nitesite. The pixel definitely tends to brighten up photos. More and bring shadows up bring highlights up. You can it's it's more of like a nighttime to daytime transformation, sort of situation happening there with pixel, where the iPhone is a bit more true to life, and then it's also taking what I think are the most detailed sharpest low-light photos of any smartphone. Even more so than a pixel, but in dim light it just it doesn't turn on very much and there is no night mode in the ultra wide camera. So really it's a great start, but no doubt it can get better over time. I think this will make a really good blind, smartphone camera test. If we, if we do like a separate bracket specifically for phones, that have a dedicated night mode now, which is a lot of them, I think they could be really good, but just in general, I am really happy that there's this new focus on smartphone cameras, I Feel like the last year of presentations of smartphones, have had more time spent on the camera than any other feature and they're all just fighting against each other to try to make the best possible camera to put in our pockets and we win from that. The iPhone 11 Pro still does the best video of any smartphone. That'S still pretty clear to me and they're also making it easier now in the UI to just quickly start taking a video. So if you see something you like you open the camera up and just hold down the shutter button, and it just starts recording so just like Instagram or snapchat, and if you want to lock it into video recording, you just drag it over to the right. And it's hands-free you're taking a video but yeah in the photo front. Their competition is pretty stiff and it's coming from all different directions. We'Re about to get pixel four. We just had the new Huawei mate 30 Pro come out. One plus 70 is right around the corner. You can count on that stuff and then I just want to touch on iOS 13 for a second, so I've been using it in beta on my iPhone 10s Macs before this came out. So I've already used the things you get again here like dark mode and the long presses and quick settings and stuff like that. It'S great a bunch of little tweaks here and there, but I got ta say it has been kind of buggy. I'Ve had some weird issues with lock screen controls, just not showing up, sometimes sometimes the camera app just freezes all together until I close it and then I've had some other weird app issues with like the Tesla app and Instagram app. But now those are fixed so yeah. I should definitely mention that, hopefully iOS 13.1 and future software updates will iron a lot of this stuff out, otherwise its iOS as you'd expect it also for those wondering the? U one chip in these new phones, which should again basically give you ultra wideband signal for referential, locating of other u1 enabled devices and should improve airdrop, that's not enabled in this version of the software. I think that's also coming in 13.1. Aside from that, we don't really know what else it does so generally, the software experience of the iPhone is pretty much unchanged same UI same feature set. You already know what it is. Nothing is dramatically or drastically different here beyond. I think night mode. So I'm not super surprised here. Look you, you probably don't need an iPhone 11 Pro, but it is a great upgrade like this actually went a lot of these improvements, even though they're small are on such core functional things to normal people like speed battery life and camera like if you were to Ask normal people what they care about the most in their phone. It'S those things, but I've said it before and I'll say it again. A lot of the features that I was looking forward to, especially when we heard was gon na be a pro phone are just not here, and that's got me hyped way too early for this 20/20 I phone or the iPhone 12 or whatever. They call that and actually new design shrinking the notch, maybe USB type-c. Of course, a high refresh rate promotion display that would have been super Pro putting touch ID back underneath the display glass reverse. While I was charging any of these things in this phone would have been would have would have felt a little more pro and would have maybe made it worth the name or just felt really cool to have. But of course none of it happened. So really the focus for this new iPhone 11 Pro has come down to the a13, the battery life, the slightly improved display, and just these new cameras you want it, you got it if you're, just someone who wants the best possible camera in your phone or if You do a lot of video creation or, if you're, a pro content creator on your phone, then you're gon na be really happy with this phone, with the new iPhone classic or even with the new iPhone 11 non pro, which is $ 300 cheaper and has the Same cameras and same processing and a great battery life, the telephoto, but again that much cheaper price that'll get its own review but I'll say as a whole. The iPhone 11 pro is a really great phone, and unless you have, the 10s is probably worth the upgrade. Just for the love of cameras, but really the big looming, reason for someone like me not to get this phone is the 20/20 iPhone or the next iPhone. So that's something to think about, but we'll stay ready for that, as I expect a lot more, but this package they've shipped today, it's pretty damn good, either way. That'S minute! Thank you for watching catch. You guys the next one pace. """
-5BsYYtyENw,Samsung Galaxy Fold Re-do: Everything New!,7:34,"Oh hey, this looks familiar and that's because it is this. Is the new updated, fixed, Samsung Galaxy fold? What'S up guys to be here so a little refresher for those who may not have heard or may have forgotten the original story? So as it goes, Samsung announced a crazy folding phone in February Galaxy fold later in the year. It starts the press cycle, so I got my hands on one. I did my first impressions, video and then I got the phone in the studio. Did an unboxing the whole deal I'll chop all the links below in case you want to go. Watch those. So there were a small handful of review units in the wild and then one by one, including mine. They started breaking for various reasons. So Samsung recalled all those review units they took mine back, everyone else gave theirs back and they took them behind closed doors and started working on figuring out what went wrong and trying to fix it, and, of course, during all this there's all the the doubters and The haters, of course, like all there's, no way they're gon na, actually try to relaunch this phone. It'S doomed. It'S just nothing should happen like this. It'S canceled - maybe maybe it's canceled, but all that brings us to right now, as you can see, it isn't canceled its back, they've fixed it and I'm actually starting to ship this thing. So, even though I already reviewed the original Galaxy fold and all its quirks and all the things I liked and disliked about it, we're gon na take another look at it. What'S different with this fixed one, and I want to show you the updates and some extra thoughts and opinions I've had so just looking at the new fold. You know you can tell, of course it's very similar. In fact, even if you paid super close attention to the original, you might not be able to tell exactly what is fixed about this new version. So here we go number one that thin layer. That appeared to be a screen protector, but is actually part of the display that may have been peeled off by some people. That'S now extended all the way to the edges and it's tucked underneath the display bezel right up to the corners and the sides. So not only don't you mistake it as a screen protector and try to peel it, but you physically can so that's good. Then too, they've added these t-shaped caps at the top and bottom of the display right at the hinge to prevent any dust or debris from basically getting into the hinge itself. So if you look at footage of the old Galaxy fold, it doesn't have these and honestly it's a. I guess, a little surprising in hindsight that it didn't have this or that they didn't. Think of this I mean it was kind of wild that the fold had big gaps here basically before, and it looked crazy that you could just have stuff get into the phone. So it's good to see that these are sealed off now. Now it's not like liquid or water resistant or anything with these caps, but it's just a little bit more protective than it was before and then there's other very subtle things like the gap. The hinge makes when the phone is closed is a little bit smaller. So you can see a crack still through the middle, but just barely. I don't think this has as much of an effect on durability, as people might say, but this is true about it and the hinge mechanism itself is a little more firm and I realize this comparison means pretty much nothing to anyone, because almost nobody has felt the Hinge of the original Galaxy fold, but I am noticing it has a more firm snap to placing it flat and then unsnapping it from flat other than that. It'S still the same. You know the same wild phone, that is a thin, screened mini phone when it's closed and a seven inch square mini tablet when it's open the same folding phone with a wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, it's the same phone with six cameras, three on the back, all Really high-end two on the inside and one on the front cover and all that means it's still fun and it's still a unique experience for gaming for web browsing. It'S awesome for email, I think and of course just multitasking in general on this absolutely huge display that you can fold and put in your pocket. The crease looks about the same to me too, and I was just curious if, while they were behind closed doors, if they would change any other little things like maybe improve the display material a bit, but it doesn't seem like anything aside from those few things are Different, it's still going to be a soft plastic because it still has to fold in half in ways that hard glass can't so much so that there's a new warning on the screen during the setup process. That includes a warning to avoid pressing the screen hard, because it's still true that, if you did your fingernails into the plastic or accidentally scratch this protective layer at the top or even just press it way too hard. You can actually damage the Galaxy fold. But look at the end of the day. I think it's a good thing that Samsung saw what was going wrong accepted. It took all of them back, they never actually shipped any to customers and fixed it internally, and you know they actually addressed what was going wrong. I only say this because I could easily see a world where some other companies maybe take the more stubborn, like Apple, like approach where, like look you're holding it wrong, you guys are using it wrong. It was breaking because of user error. It'Ll be fine, just ship. It anyway and that's something I'm glad Samsung didn't do like, let's just be totally real, they copy Apple and a lot of things. I'M glad they didn't copy that it's just so wild that this all came down to a few little faults of the highly engineered hinge that had to happen to make this folding phone possible. But then they had to go ahead and re-engineer it again, because the damn users kept breaking it, but hey that's what it comes down to if you keep a product completely and totally secret like this, and you never take it really out of a lab to test It with real people, then the first real people that use it are gon na. Do things that you may have never thought of doing in a lab, like you know, folding it with things other than robot hands and putting it in lint filled pockets and going to beaches with sand everywhere and just all kinds of crazy stuff, like that, this new Fixed galaxy fold is not a radically different phone, as you can tell it's very similar, it's still a delicate phone. That, honestly, I think probably people are going to still break this when they get it or a month after they get it or a year after they get this phone, but what it represents, I think, is Samsung taking a stance really that they believe in this this Whole foldable phone form factor thing in the first place. My feelings on this phone are pretty much the same, which is that I'm just really happy it exists, even if I wouldn't use it as my daily phone necessarily I really did enjoy using it. It has a lot of great things about it, but wouldn't use it. I don't think on the daily, but I'm glad it exists and I'm glad that companies actually take big risks like this. Still in a world of you know, maybe more iterative phones, like you just saw the new iPhone it's very similar to the last one. Big risks like this and it's clear that this was a risk we saw what happened are still awesome to see. So I hope we someday get a Samsung Galaxy fold too. Maybe next year I have no idea what that would look like or what would be different about it. It'S pretty wild just seeing this first one, but I hope we get a sequel either way. That'S it for this quick update. Also, do you want one of these because I do have an extra one thanks to D brand, I'm gon na do a giveaway of a samsung galaxy fold on Twitter sometime in the next 48 hours, or so so go follow over there. If you haven't already to get in on that and hey, maybe I'll get lucky either way again, that's been it. Thank you for watching and I'll catch. You guys later bass. """
#NAME?,Asus ROG Phone 2 Review: The Spec King!,12:24,"Asus rog phone to the phone with every speck maxed out the absolute dream phone on paper. So the question is: how well do specks on paper, translate to real-world use in a phone and is pretty much the perfect phone to find that out? This is one of those phones that people sent me a whole lot to check out because well I made that dream phone video a little while back where I had all these crazy specs that I wanted to see in a phone and then Asus announced this and The spec sheet people said Oh mark is, it looks like they made. Basically your dream phone, so I picked it up and I've been using it. I brought it to the Apple event that I've been using this phone for more than a week now, and I can tell you exactly what I think, but this is the spec sheet. I just I just want to put this in one place for all of you who will appreciate this. Just listen to this world-class spec sheet: snapdragon. 855. 12 gigs of ram one terabyte of ufs, 3.0 storage, a six point: six inch, 120 hertz OLED display a 6,000 milliamp hour battery and 48 megapixel dual cameras on paper. This is the best phone you can buy in almost every metric best chip, most Ram biggest storage, fastest display biggest battery straight across the board and with room still for a headphone jet. So how does absolutely dominating a spec sheet actually translate to real world use? Spoiler? Pretty good so, first of all the design, the package that you stuff all the specs into it's pretty similar to the first ROG phone they've toned it down a little bit. You know there's a little less copper, a little less thin action, but it's still unmistakeably a gaming phone. Of course the aesthetic isn't subtle and the design is a bit more subjective. It'S not really on the spec sheet. This is just what it looks like if you're cool carrying around a phone that looks like this or not and there's a certain type of person that will be I'll, say the number one thing you'll notice more than the glowing logo more than the vent cutout for Cooling, more than the circuit lines and the design that reflect a rainbow or a glow colors is that it's just absolutely huge like there are small phones and there are big phones. This is a huge phone. You need a big footprint to fit all these specs and then, since it's made mostly of metal which is dense and with that battery. This is a really heavy phone about 240 grams to be exact, and you really feel that weight in your pocket and holding this thing, I'm cool with it. I, like big phones, but you might have to see it or hold it in person to really like actually feel how big it is. That'S what she said and then from there a lot of the design choices are made specifically with the gamer in mind, but a lot of them just end up being nice for people who, just like media in general, so things like the USB type-c port is down On the side here, so you can still charge it while holding the phone sideways and it doesn't get in the way. There are also dual front-facing stereo speakers and they are incredible speakers. You know in a world where headphone jacks are slowly dying off but being replaced by a wireless audio. The dual stereo front-facing speakers set is also an endangered species and I'd like to bring awareness to that, and there really isn't much of a great replacement they're. Just worse speakers now, but yeah, these are really good, crisp, loud and clear. So, overall, the design of course isn't for everyone. In fact, I prefer something a little cleaner, a little bit more understated, but there is a lot of good choices here. So I can respect that so, okay, then the specs first main specs are Snapdragon a 55 plus and 12 gigs of DDR 4 Ram. So of course it's gon na be extremely fast, launching apps and then keeping a lot of them in memory and flipping through them. Yeah having the highest end available, specs here does great, but then there actually are some other things that make it feel even faster number. One is the ufs 3.0 storage, it's really fast storage, that's helped. Phones, like the oneplus 7 pro and the galaxy fold feel much faster, including installing apps really quickly and launching apps really quickly and then number two is this display? It'S a six point: six inch, 120 Hertz AMOLED 1080p panel and so saying that out loud is that's a pretty unique spec sheet. That'S a great number, but you got actually look at it. It is a very fast display, actually the fastest mobile display that I've ever seen. You can turn it down to the normal 60 Hertz. If you want, you can bump it up to 90 Hertz or just keep it at 120. All the time like I did, and it also has a 240 Hertz touch response refresh. So it's super, quick and responsive to your touch. Scrolling, for example, is super smooth. You, of course, can't really fully appreciate it through this video, which is only 30 FPS, but I guess take my word for it. It'S really snappy, I think, is the keyword very smooth and snappy so scrolling, the UI and any app, of course that supports the higher framerate. Look awesome, there's a whole list of games that support it, but I've said it once and I'll say it again: high refresh rate all the things please, but it's not the best. Looking OLED in the world, it's 1080p for one which, on a 6.6 inch screen, is not a huge deal, but it's worth noting like it's, not a low resolution, it's still almost 400 PPI but versus a 1440p display. You can't tell the difference and then colors and contrast just felt a little strange to me at times it has adjustable color profiles, but I never quite felt happy with the color calibration. It gets up to 600 nits, which is decently bright, but it doesn't get very dim at night, which I actually found much more annoying when it's dark, and I wish my phone wasn't so freakin bright. It also has a fingerprint reader underneath the display glass and it's nowhere near the best ones. I'Ve used it's not always glitchy, but it is glitchy more often than any other ones. I'Ve used. It is definitely optical. As you can see, you know, with the light shining on my fingerprint as it tries to read it, and it also has this weird artifact that's kind of hard to capture, but at lower brightness. When you go to unlock with your fingerprint, the whole display sort of bumps up in brightness a little bit and gets really grainy and weird. Looking as it reads, then just goes back to normal when it's done, it's not actually a problem or anything, but it's just a fascinatingly weird thing to see happen. So specs it's got those for sure. But like always, you have to look a little bit past the numbers to find and see interesting things like that. But then speaking of numbers here are some other numbers to think about up to a terabyte of built-in storage. So that's that's pretty great. There is no expandable storage, but let's be real, you probably don't need more than a terabyte, so that number translates pretty well and then 6000. This is a six thousand milliamp hour battery and that, as you can imagine, also translates through well, that is the biggest battery I've ever used in any smartphone, even at a hundred and twenty Hertz all the time. I'Ve never gotten close to killing this phone in a day on a super heavy day with me, where I had a lot of unplugged navigation and music streaming, and I just intentionally never plugged in during the day, I ended the day after 10:00 p.m. with about five Hours of screen on time and half battery left Wow. Just I don't know it's my dream. Smartphone battery literally never ever worrying about. If I'm gon na have to charge during the day and then just plug it in every night, you could probably go on a weekend. Road trip and not bring your charger and come back two days later, with like 30 % battery for real and, if you're ever worried. For some reason, you're gon na have to go like four straight days without charging like this is the dream scenario for a battery. In a smart phone you could just turn it down to 90 Hertz or turn it down to 60 Hertz and you're good for a while so yeah. This is a that number 6000 translates very well, then here's another number: 48, it's a 48 megapixel primary camera. On the back at F 1.79, this turns out is one of those specs where you can just kind of ignore the number you might be tempted to believe 48. Megapixels automatically means it's good, but this you know it's a decent camera. I'D give it a B b-minus for quality, maybe with great software tuning or G cam. It could get up to a B, but it's not blowing anyone's minds here. Images can look pretty good when you give them a lot of light, of course, and it does have great HDR, but sharpness and color. I'Ve noticed and white balance are more inconsistent. They can hit or miss and there's actually a bit of noticeable shutter lag, which I thought was strange for a phone, that's otherwise so incredibly fast, but it also has a 13 megapixel ultra wide at 125 degree field of view and similar to some other phones. I'M glad it has one, but the inconsistency between the two cameras, especially as far as color and sharpness and detail, is major. So you know it's an extra fun camera to have, but clearly not as high quality. This has kind of been one of the themes. I'Ve noticed about gaming. Phones, though, is that people who use these don't really take a ton of photos or care as much about the critical quality of photos on videos. So the cameras are just good enough matter of fact for reference, a reviewers guide for the phone. Just to go over all the features and things I should check out it's 41 pages long and the camera stuff is not talked about at all until page 36, so you know I do actually want to give a sous major props or something though so, if you Remember the first asus rog phone that software was a little bit over the top, the the themes and the icons very gamer ii and the mechanical sounds, and it was a bit much so i did criticize it a bit in that first video well an ROG phone When you first set it up, you get the option to choose between that very heavy ROG UI or this sort of near stock clean Zen UI, and that is what I like to see. I am now happy with the software experience on the ROG phone. I of course chose the new Zen UI and so there's no Goudy icons or robot sound effects or anything crazy like that. It'S something closer to maybe like an oxygen OS or any other light skin on Android, not sure about the upgrade schedule. Still Android 10 is starting to roll out and it's just kind of a pixel thing for right now, but I'm impressed with what we have here so far. There are still plenty of gaming features. Of course, though, it wouldn't be a republic of gamers phone. Without that, there's still the armory create and game modes Game Genie X mode, the system, lighting control - it's all still here, don't worry, there's even improved air triggers on each side of the phone for gaming and landscape. But if I'm being perfectly real, I don't play a whole ton of like really intense games on my phone. I don't play fortnight on my phone so like I guess it says something that even a phone, that's not targeted directly to me, has still been so enjoyable to use. This is a really great phone. Now is probably still gon na go a bit under the radar. Just because it's not gon na be in carrier stores and it's a gamer phone by a smaller company. So it feels much more niche. But if you get excited about this type of thing or if you're a gamer on your phone or if you just saw the spec sheet and went that looks sick, then you are squarely in the target demographic of people who will really enjoy using us. It'S not perfect, you know there are small trade-offs. The cameras aren't world-class. The all metal body is solid, of course, and it's going to be heavy, but also means no wireless charging and there's also no official water resistance or IP rating, and the phones Achilles heel really is just the size of the damn thing. So here we are at the end of the review, if you're, finding yourself sitting there thinking wow. I really want to know if I can tell the difference between that 120 Hertz and 90 Hertz versus 60 with my eye, and I can't wait to play these games at high frame rates. Yeah you'll love this phone, you know so turns out. The spec King on paper does deliver in real life, and it also turns out design is very important, but let me know what you think: do just the specs make it the dream phone, or would you buy this phone just for the specs over something a little More tame, I'm curious what you think, let me know either way. Thank you for watching catch. You guys in the next one peace. """
pyldH6sefTQ,Samsung Galaxy Note 10: But Why Tho?,9:44,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm Cathy HD here - and this is the Samsung Galaxy - Note 10 year process. I just saw this your last video was about the Galaxy Note 10. That was about the Galaxy Note 10, the bigger flagship phone with a lot of the bells and whistles that sort of fits perfectly. In the Note brand, this is the Galaxy Note. 10. It'S missing a bunch of what the note 10 plus has, and it's still 950 bucks and I still kind of like it. Let'S talk about it, so if I'm being perfectly real Samsung could've, maybe should have called this. The note 10 e, this phone is a sort of a trimmed-down version in a lot of ways, kind of the same way. The s10 II was a trimmed-down version of the s10, but for a bit less money, so I think best way to review this phone is basically to show exactly what's different about this note, 10 versus the note 10, plus that I just dropped a 15 minute video On so I'll link that full review right below the like button, if you haven't seen that one yet this is the note 10. So, first of all, it's a hundred. Fifty bucks cheaper, like I said, which posted at 9:49 to start and it's kind of a little brother, and I say that because the most obvious difference is it's physically smaller now, usually I'd always go for the biggest possible version of any phone, but so many phones Have all gotten so huge these days that it's actually kind of refreshing having a smaller flagship phone, so the note 10 is smaller than the iPhone 10's Mac's smaller than the 1 plus 7 Pro I'd been using before I can reach all four corners fairly easily. It'S it's actually really nice not having to stretch to reach the top on these giant phones. Just to get to notifications, I don't have any one-handed assist features turned on anymore on this phone, it's kind of nice. You know I've. It'S been a while, since I've used a phone, that's actually this small, which is plenty to say about a Galaxy Note. It'S a 6.3 inch display, bezels, still tiny. You know still the boxy overall shape and another spec difference that a lot of people focus on is it's now a 1080p display, instead of the 1440p, that the big brother had now. This spec is a perfect example of something that matters to many people. A lot more on paper than in real life like if you haven't seen the Galaxy Note 10. If you haven't actually used this phone, you might see on the spec sheet that it's such an expensive phone, but it only has a 1080p display and that sticks out. Like a sore thumb, but in reality this display is pretty much great with that resolution. You'D be concerned about sharpness, but it's still pretty sharp at over 400 PPI. So you never really see any pixels still gets extremely bright or extremely dim. Colors still look pretty good. It'S just mainly smaller the hole punch cut out, even though it's the same size appears just a tiny bit bigger, since the phone is smaller, but overall it's still not a huge distraction at all. I think if it was a notch, like the iPhone I'd, find it a bit more intrusive on this smaller screen, but even you know full screen, videos or gaming, and things like that are still fine. Here I still do miss not having 90 Hertz or any sort of high refresh rate, but aside from that, this screen has been pretty excellent. I just think still because it's 950 dollars, you just sort of want it - to have everything you want it to have a 1440p display at this price. That'S one of the only ways it really feels disappointing everything else. Aesthetically is pretty much identical to the big brother. Just shrunken down, which makes things more reachable more pocketable and more holdable, so the cameras are exactly the same. This speakers are exactly the same. The fingerprint reader is the same, and the buttons are the same, but they're even more reachable, so they're a little bit lower. I didn't have a problem reaching them on the note 10 plus, but if you did, these are a little closer. The software is also all still the same, but for some reason - and they did this on the galaxy s 10 II - also on the smaller phone - they don't give you the option to change your screen resolution on a phone with a 1440p display. They let you pick if you want to jump down to 1080 or backup on a phone with a 1080p display, they hide it. Maybe it's because they think it's fine to just leave it at 1080. Max res all the time I don't know, but I would have at least liked to have seen the option here. Since this is the Galaxy Note, the S Pen is exactly the same. I was actually kind of wondering if the smaller phone would get a smaller stylus, but no exact same stylus on the bigger phone with all the same features and gestures, and then performance is, for all intents and purposes the same, but with some small spec differences. So the note 10 spec will always be 8 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of that high-speed storage. None of that is expandable here. The note 10 plus, like we talked about before, can bump up to 12 gigs of ram and 512 gigs of internal storage, and it has the expandable storage via microsd, and I think that for 90, something percent of users that 8 gigs of ram is plenty and The 256 gigs of storage is enough, but if you need more, you should consider the note plus a couple of small things. One note 10 has a bit of a smaller battery. 3500 milliamp hours is the official number kind of small for a flagship actually in 2019, but after using it for a while, it became apparent that it doesn't matter as much because it has a 1080p display. If you bump up the resolution on the 10 plus, you will start to get worse battery life. I kind of left it in the middle got my four and a half hours of screen on time. This phone with the smaller battery, but a 1080p display got me. Those same great numbers for battery about a 4-hour screen on time, which is pretty good battery life and then note 10 also lacks the support for the superfast 45 watt ultra fast charger. I don't know if that's a space thing or just a cost savings thing, but it will still come in the box with the 25 watt charger, which is pretty good. If you get the expense of extra one. It'Ll only work with the 10 plus and then Note 10. While I said it does have the same cameras, it doesn't have the extra depth sensors on the back, as you can see that the 10 plus has so yeah no AR doodle or anything crazy with depth. Sensing like that, although it still does port remote and live focus, video just fine. So, overall, you know there's a good amount of stuff missing, but it's also still very much a premium phone with a premium build and the high-end specs, and it turns out the things that were sort of the most concerning to me, which were the display and the Battery life sort of worked hand in hand with each other to be fine, so it's still a great phone in a vacuum, but we're not in a vacuum. This is a world where other phones, where other options exist. This is a world where the Gow cs10 plus also exists. Now, why do I bring this up? Here'S the thing: here's the thing Samsung is a smart company. You know plenty of smart people working over there, but back in just March it seems like they've made a phone, that's better in a lot of ways than the note and for less money. Galaxy S 10 plus came out just a few months ago, and if you look at how similar they are, they have the same specs. You know some on the s10 plus are actually better, so they both have the Snapdragon a 55. But you can go up to 12 gigs of ram. It has a bigger higher resolution, display it's 6.4 inches and 1440p same ultrasonic, fingerprint sensor, better speakers in my opinion, and it has basically the same triple cameras on the back but sideways instead of vertical, and you get a second sensor on the front. Fear a depth. Sensing that the note doesn't have - and it's much more rounded and tapered, of course, but you also get that extra button, so Bixby fans, it is remappable and you basically trade, the s-pen for a headphone jack and a much bigger 4100 million power battery. That is that that's a lot of reasons to get the s10 plus over the note and it's cheaper. It starts at. I don't eight hundred bucks right now and B. """
WpPw7lUXyI0,Redmi K20 Pro Review: Incredible Value!,10:28,"Read me k20 Pro, depending on who you are you've, either heard a ton of hype around this for a while now - or this is literally the first time you're ever hearing about it right now, I feel like this phone picks up right, where the polka phone left Off it's very similar to the polka phone in more ways than one, but instead of just nailing a few key specs for a super low price. This red-meat k20 pro feels like a super complete all-around, basically flagship level phone. It has essentially everything for 400 bucks and that's why it's blowing up it's definitely more expensive than the 300 dollar polka phone, which is absolutely crazy, but this in this package is definitely a better more all-around phone you'll see what I mean, but first I want to Address the whole naming scheme so when I was first put onto this phone, you guys put it on my radar a lot of tweets at me. A lot of emails asking me to review red-meat k20 Pro. So I look it up and it looks like this. So I looked out on my desk and I already have this phone right here, so I'm like. Oh, I already have a k20 Pro except it's not it says, says me on the back and it came in a box from Xiaomi. That said, Xiaomi me 90. There'S a couple other slightly different things about it, but they look nearly identical. So I look up the specs of this mean 90 to see how similar they are. It'S essentially exactly the same as the k20 Pro, but with a snapdragon 730. But then I unbox it and I log in to my Google account on it and it says: welcome to your read me K 20, which is making me even more confused, but then I finally do get. The read me: K. 20 Pro turns out the K. 20. Pro is just an upgraded version of the K 20. This has the Snapdragon 855. The K 20 has a Snapdragon 730, which has a global version called the Xiaomi me 90, which is an upgraded version of the Xiaomi me 9. If you follow all of that, but none of that really matters. What matters is the K 20 Pro deserves. The attention is getting because it legitimately tries to include literally everything you could possibly expect out of a flagship, but out of lower price. Now it's not all the highest-quality, it definitely has a quantity, it has almost everything, but it's still a 400 ollar phone, so aesthetically. First of all, it's pretty unique, looking with the colors sort of dancing down the sides and then depending on how the light hits it. This shimmery pattern changes it's pretty cool, but it's actually also still glass and still a fingerprint magnet, but this thing is already starting off with a leg up. You typically expect budget phones to have plastic and cheap materials. This one is legit metal and glass. Usb type-c. You got it a slight curve to the bag glass. You got it headphone jack. You got that a full-screen display from top to bottom thin bezels. You got it pop-up, selfie camera. You got it a built-in LED light fingerprint reader underneath the glass. You got that too. Four thousand milliamp power battery. You got that Snapdragon. 855. It'S all here, pretty much. The only hardware thing this guy is missing. If you're, comparing it to flagships, is water resistance and wireless charging. So you know it is a glass back with no wireless charging. I'Ve said before, if you're gon na do that, just go with a high quality plastic, so you avoid being breakable. But oh well, so, like I've said the list of things that this phone has as you've heard, is kind of amazing, but the actual quality of all. These different things varies: not all specs are created, equal, the natural place to start as a display, and it's pretty nice. To be honest, it's a six point, four inch, 1080p AMOLED, no notch thin bezels and it's pretty bright, its visible outdoors with fairly decent colors. Maybe a little big, if anything, but we're so used to seeing so many budget phones with either big chins and big bezels or smaller screens or notches this one's just clean and it's flat. So I'm reminded again of how much I liked this versus the displays that sort of spill over the sides. So I really like this screen to me. This is the best display in any mid-range phone and then underneath that display glass. There is a fingerprint reader which again that's pretty impressive for a mid-range er at the fact that it's there in the first place, but this reader itself - it's not that fast, so you can kind of get used to it. It'S a little bit of a delay when you press it, but it's in this weird place where it's slower than most other in glass, fingerprint readers on great phones but also slower than the capacitive ones are used to. But at least it's cooler, it's under the screen and then like we've, also seen lately to achieve the full screen, design, pop-up selfie camera, and this one has a light on it. I don't know if that achieves anything other than looking kind of cool, but the mechanism is decently fast. It'S rated for 300,000 opens and closes. You can't use it for RGB face unlock, but I don't recommend that and it even has automatic freefall detection. So if you're taking a selfie and you drop the phone and it has a freefall, it actually closes the camera app and shuts it to avoid damage if it lands on it. But a low-key, pretty important part of it is that light in the selfie. Camera actually shines through the top of it, so it can act as a sort of a notification LED. So you can see if you're plugged in and charging it lights up to tell you and when you're finished charging that changes really. The only thing I don't like about this selfie camera is the photos it takes, which are straight garbage like this is possibly the worst selfie camera I can remember using since I started to review phones. There'S absolutely no dynamic range colours are pretty terrible at a very, very soft detail. Yes, beauty mode is off like I just don't know why it's this bad, but you know what makes it even more crazy how good the back cameras are. This k20 Pro again has yet another flagship, looking spec an array of triple cameras on the back, a 48 megapixel main camera, an 8 megapixel telephoto and a 13 megapixel ultra wide. So that main sensor is a Sony. It'S an amx 586. So it's the same sensor that we've seen in a couple other honor and vivo phones that have performed pretty well: it'll shoot 4k 60fps video with any of the camera lenses. So, yes, you can shoot video with the ultra wide camera, unlike the 1 plus 7 Pro it'll even shoot 960 FPS slow-motion. Now it's not high resolution at all, but you know definitely more of a gimmick, but that's still pretty cool and then for photos. I was, of course, expecting maybe some average photos some that maybe look better if they're in great light - and I was very impressed. Obviously, if you give it a ton of light, you're going to get the best out of the sensor - and this stayed true - HDR was working pretty great, but even the ultra wide camera was giving me some nice shots. The every production wasn't too oversaturated or overdone with the processing. Sometimes you see too much sharpening in these phones that wasn't here. I was more impressed often than I thought I would be: it's not the fastest camera in the world, but overall the image quality, not bad, and even at night, like in in dark environments where you expect it to fall apart, yeah it totally does the noise reduction Goes super overboard and everything is super soft and it looks terrible. But if you happen to have a subject that will sit still for you and you turn on night mode, you get some of your sharpness back and the dynamic range actually improves like that's. That'S. That'S pretty good, that's not bad! So really, the only thing left is using the phone every day and again, like I said technically on paper, it has all those things you'd expect from a flagship, snapdragon, a 55 six or eight gigs of ram and up to 256 gigs of storage. So it's running MIUI 10 on top of Android Pi, and this is not my first choice, but it's growing on me so aesthetically. This is why it's not my favorite but functionally it's not lacking at all. The app drawer with the search bar at the bottom is nice for each ability. It actually has a nice clean, brightness slider that I've liked for a while, it's like always available, but the glassiness of it all and the the icons just certain things are a little too much for me and that's kind of their aesthetic right now, but overall performance. I'D say it was about a B, and this is something I actually expect it to be better when you have these high-end specs, but the animations weren't really smooth all the time. I got occasional hiccups with the keyboard and with opening stuff minor things but stuff you don't really expect to see from a phone with a 1080p display and a high-end chip. So it's still fast, but not really that smooth, if that makes sense, but that battery, though that four thousand milliamp hour battery they put in this phone, gives it a battery life that is right up to par with the other flagship, sometimes better than the 1 7 / I've been using, and not only does it have a really large battery and support fast charging, but it also comes with a fast charger in the box and it has this sweet charging animation. So the battery life situation is pretty great on this phone. Look, I'm going to tell you right now for the price red-meat K. 20. Pro is a great phone it I think it gets you the closest to forgetting that you spent half what you could have spent on a high-end phone. It gets you the closest to that, but a lot of this is easy to just point out on paper when you actually use it. There are certain things that keep reminding you that it is a cheaper phone. The vibration motor, for example, pretty cheap, pretty loose, not very good, and when you feel that all the time you're reminded also the single mono speaker at the bottom is super easy to block and that's pretty bad. So if you do audio all the time, you're reminded the selfie camera, like I talked about, is just absolutely comically awful and even little things like the slower fingerprint reader. You might not know it's slow if you haven't used a more expensive phone, but I definitely did notice it, but for the most part, the important stuff, the big stuff, your specs, your overall solid, build quality, your solid performance, the headphone jack, is a nice touch and The display being better than I expected sort of fits this where the polka phone left off, which is a really really great value and kind of like that polka phone, even if you never buy this redmi k20 pro or even the xiaomi me 90. This is still a testament to how good these mid-range and budget phones have gotten lately. So maybe I can't say: good phones are getting cheap anymore. Maybe we'll put a little strikeout through that one, but I definitely can say: cheap phones are getting good and I'm glad this one exists to be a part of that movement. That'S been it thanks for watching catch, you guys the next one peace """
YPln3JP_gKs,Bose Headphones 700: The King is Back!,6:49,"And what's up guys, I'm kV HD here, and these are the new bose noise-canceling headphones 700 terrible name. That might be the worst thing about these headphones. So when I first saw that Bose announced these, they kind of took me by surprise. But the more you think about them and use them the more it makes perfect sense. These are a prime example of competition driving things forward and making better products for us. The consumers you'll see what I mean, so the most striking part is, of course, the new. Pretty minimal design, I don't love it, I mean it's definitely a unique look, it looks fine, I think the look they're going for here is minimal and clean, but I like that there's still map, like everything, there's also a silver version. I like that, it's pretty lightweight still and I like that, there's still over ear, but they've kind of seemingly gotten rid of any visible hinges or any broken lines at all. It just kind of looks like these smooth ear cups attached to one single stock, but you can still rotate them around and it still gives you pretty much. A hundred percent of the flexibility you had before the top band is still soft and the clamp force is still pretty solid. You put them on and even before, turning them on they've created a nice seal. It'S just definitely a very unique look. I think the only thing I really don't like, even though I totally get it is the adjustability for height, as you can see, is now just this smooth slide instead of the clicks, usually get from like every other pair of headphones. So this is less satisfying, but you know it makes sense with this really smooth minimal. Look but then pretty much. All the new features that they've added are a direct response to all the headphones that have been coming out over the past year that I've had all kinds of cool features that have sort of passed them up like. If you look back the bose QC series that iconic QuietComfort headphones lineup has been kind of the same, almost stubbornly for the past couple years, even as we evolved just because they kind of settled in as the industry standard people knew that if you wanted noise cancelling Headphones, you just got those, but then along came the Microsoft Surface headphones and the Sony XM 3s and just a bunch of others in the last year that really had all these crazy 20:19 features that started to, I think, actually eat into their sales. So they had to respond so now these new features we get in the 700, I'm just calling them the 700s. Many of these new features are just straight from what we just got in this new competition, so the 700s now finally have USB type-c, where all the quiet comforts were microUSB. These will now also they'll connect to two different Bluetooth devices at once and can instantly swap back and forth between them. Love that you now have also a touchpad on the side of the right headphone with MIDI controls, so double tap the touchpad to play and pause, swipe up or swipe down to change the volume up or down and swipe forward to go forward swipe backward to go Back, it's not cold enough for me to test if these like stop working when it's cold or anything like that, but they seem to work pretty great now and then there are three physical buttons. So on the right side there is the power, slash Bluetooth button. So single tap turns it on and off, and a long press goes to pairing mode and on the second button over here is your assistant button. So you tap it and it'll pause your music and use the excellent built-in mics to let you ask Google assistant things and then on the left side is a noise cancellation adjustment button. So you can cycle between a maximum of 10 out of 10 5 out of 10 or 0 out of 10 noise cancellation and those presets are customizable and then the Bose music app is all fresh and clean and it'll. Tell you exactly how much better you have left to the minute and it'll, let you dial in any noise cancellation level from 1 to 10 at any time, which is super specific and you can change what assistant the assistant button triggers. So if you have a Samsung phone, you can do bixby. Maybe you want Alexa. Maybe you want Siri, that's your call with that. Bose app, notably doesn't have, is any sort of EQ control. So if you're someone who wants to have that extra bass or you want to add to messing with the way it sounds out the box, these don't do it from the Bose app and I'll say these sound just about as high quality as any bluetooth. Headphones have been and their sound signature. The way they sound is unsurprisingly kind of flat, like that's just the way. Bose headphones have sounded for the past couple years, with the quiet comforts, if you're in it. For that big thumping bass, you might find these a bit lackluster or disappointing, but you're rarely buying these for the big thumping bass, you're buying them for the noise cancellation, and they definitely deliver on that. But it's not all roses. There are a couple other things to consider: aren't just upgraded features so, like I mentioned it has USB type-c, which is great, but on the other side they have a 2.5 millimeter headphone jack instead of 3.5. So if you run out of battery or you want to plug in wired audio, for some reason you have to use - I guess they're included 2.5 millimeter to 3.5 millimeter cable instead of any old, regular audio cable that you have ready to go. That'S kind of disappointing! The case also compared to the competition is decently compact, but not the smallest. I think the Sony's would win again for smallest overall travel size because they actually fold, but the Bose case does have this neat magnetic flap covering the pocket to put in the cables. So that's pretty cool, but I also noticed it doesn't come with the airline adapter anymore. This is the one that came with the Sony's and they've come with Bose QuietComfort ones in the past, and I feel like just including this made me remember that this was like the default headphones that you listen to on a plane, but they're not included with the 700Th, so I don't know, maybe they just assume you already have one overall, though, just as a package, this is the upgrade that we've been waiting for from Bose the sleeping giant of noise. Cancelling headphones finally got poked enough times into making a move and delivering this a better overall product in pretty much every possible way from the previous generation. It'S better for us. So the natural question - a lot of you probably wondering - is these or the Sony's. The Mark threes that I recently have claimed and a lot of people agree, are pretty much the king of noise cancelling headphones now, which would you pick and there's a lot of good reasons now for each of them. But here's what I will say the Sony's are lighter because of their plastic. They also fold down smaller, better for traveling longer battery life and they're $ 50 cheaper. But if you're buying headphones for noise cancellation, the Bose are back on top as far as actual quality of noise cancellation, the quality of the built-in mics is incredible, and the overall build quality of the Bose headphones is superior. So for the money the Sony might be. A little bit of a better Buy, Plus, I prefer the sound from these with a little more character, a little more fun, but I'm glad the competition has brought us yet another incredible choice: that's what you get for having better products around so companies compete. We win there, it is hey thanks for watching catch, you guys the next one peace """
JdTBIHX-r0M,PowerBeats Pro Review: Better than AirPods!,7:20,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kim PhD here, and these are the power beats Pro. That'S right, I'm reviewing beats so you may have seen or heard about these in various ads, like the one you just watched, and I do got to say, even though everyone in that actual commercial was technically a professional athlete. I still think the word Pro is overused in products like. Why are these? The power beats Pro, but that's a rant for another day. At the end of the day, these are just headphones. So when I started using these, I just want to know how good of headphones are they and are they worth the money because they are two hundred and fifty dollars, so they better be good. Then again they are beats now it turns out spoiler. They are pretty great, I still think they're overpriced, but as wireless earbuds they're pretty great, so you can think of these as air pods, but if Apple actually cared about them staying in people's ears so easily. My favorite part about these power beats Pro is how they're built like I've, never been a huge earbuds kind of guy, but for working out and for moving around and things like that. You have to have something lightweight. So that's why I prefer earbuds and I just got to stay in my ears and be comfortable ear. Pods, never really fit in my ears. I wasn't as lucky as a lot of you guys, but there are two main differences with these versus air pods that actually keep it in my ear so number one similar to Jaybirds i've had in the past. These have a soft touch, replaceable, ear tip that you can put different sizes on so instead of having just hard plastic, one size fits all. These are soft touch and they fit pretty well and the number two this piece that goes basically over and around your ear and then holds it snugly to hold the earbuds in, and these I mean you can either get the kind that go into the ear up. Here, or over and around I actually really like these, the first pair of earbuds, I ever really used a lot in high school, also had these and they're they're not coming off. So just generally, I like the design. I got the black ones, so they're all matte black plastic, sweat proof, of course, and the clamp force wallet is snug. It isn't too tight and the sign of any good pair of headphones is that you can wear them for a long time and after a while, you just kind of forget you're wearing them that good okay. They also differ from air pods. In a couple of not-so-great ways, the first one being this case, it maybe looks like a small case which is me holding it in my hand, but this is a huge case. I mean, I guess I do love that they include a matte black protective hardshell case with them with built in battery and charging there's a little light on the outside of the case and there's a pair of button on the inside. That'S all great, but this actually makes me really appreciate the air pods and they're super small wireless charging case. Of course, air pods are smaller, but the air pods case is actually pocketable easily. The beats case just is not so that's kind of a big deal. Sometimes, if you're you know walking around and you just don't have a bag. If you have a gym bag, you can toss it in there. But if you don't, this is not great in the pocket and then the case only charges via lightning. So no USB type-c and no wireless charging, so even with all this space and even putting them actually in the case was this motion that for some reason I never quite got used to obviously air pods - you just drop it in there and there's magnets, and it's Super easy: these have magnets too, and you can see the pins, but it's not quite as smooth. You have to get the angle just right. I don't know - maybe that's just me, but then the best difference with these versus air pods is the actual, but so number one they actually do sound better yeah. You know they're a little bit bass heavy, but I mean come on. Would you expect their beats? I'M not looking for a flat sound signature here. They'Re fun good sounding headphones, this seal that you can create, with the rubber tip in your ear, plus the clamp force on the side and them not coming out they're a rich good sounding pair of headphone, but then number two, the actual physical buttons on them. There'S no touch points, there's real buttons, so on the right year the beats logo is a button, and that can be your play. Pause of course, double tap for the next song triple tap for the previous and on top of each earbud, is a volume rocker. So this is better than voice control better than the swiping across panels of the sides of headphones. It'S just simple and easy: regular volume, rocker and not over-engineered love it. Of course. If you still want to use voice control you can they have the h1 chip. So you can do a little hasty reaction if you have an iPhone and they'll still respond to that sorry for triggering anyone's home pod. If anyone still has home pods out there, but anyway, that brings us to a couple of ways that these are similar to air pods. By the way I'm comparing these two air pods because well Apple, bought beats. So beats are Apple headphones now, but also because they're just the most popular headphones. Everyone has. So, if there's that so the power beats Pro have the h1 chip in them, which means they do that sweet, instant pairing with an iPhone or just regular bluetooth pairing with any Android phone, just like air pods and there's also auto play pause when you take them Out your ears and put them back in they'll also do the Siri voice command if you're into that or if you're, on an Android phone, you can long press the beats logo to trigger Google assistant or whatever assisting you use, and then the battery life is just As good, so thankfully, eight plus hours of playback easily has automatic standby. If you put them down when they're, not in the case, they can go for me like a week without charging. If I start with a full battery and a full case - and on top of that, there is fast charging, so if they're dead, you can drop them in the case for like five minutes and it gets you over an hour of listen time. So that's pretty clutch! So air pods to are already pretty expensive at 160 bucks, but, like I said these are two hundred and fifty dollars for a pair of power beats Pro, so while they are better than air pods. Yes, especially for someone like me, I still don't know. If I can say they're worth two hundred fifty dollars, I guess if you absolutely must have the completely wireless, you know no wire between the buds, then you know I guess that makes sense. These are some of the best ones, especially if you're an athlete. If you need them to be sweat proof, you need them to stay in your ears. While you move around a lot, you need workout headphones. I wouldn't blame you. If you got these, you probably be very happy with them, but just because these are so expensive. I feel like you, can easily recommend something I've used in the past and jaybird X fours. They do have a wire between them, but they're super lightweight great battery life, sweat proof. They stay in my ears, just fine and there's somewhere around like a hundred 110 bucks. So I'll leave links to the alternative stuff that I'm talking about right below the like button, as well as links to the beats, but I think the price is the only thing holding these back over. All the stamp of Apple is very evident on the power beats Pro from the h1 ship to they're very high price tag, but overall, there's not much negative. There'S not much bad to say about these so credit for that they actually made a good pair of headphones and I live up to the ads. So that's that's good to know regrets. I think I just recommend that a pair of Beats on video thanks for watching get you guys in the next one peace. """
MOJ1_FtDGNs,OnePlus 7: Way Under the Radar!,6:25,"Hey what is up guys Mk PhD here - and this is the one plus seven - not the one, plus seven Pro - the one plus seven so that phone that you might have forgotten existed. But if you know anything about oneplus phones, it became pretty familiar pretty quick. So we had the one plus seven pro already i've raved about this phone and i'll link the full review below. If you want to check it out, the seven is just like the one plus sixty but refreshed for this year. So we already have the one plus six it got refreshed. A couple months later became the one plus sixty. So this is like a1 plus 6t t, so it doesn't have any of the crazy features of the pro it's just a solid, steady phone making all the safe moves for a lower price. It has a teardrop notch. Instead of the pop up camera, it's our classic. 1080P 60. Here it's OLED display they've been going with. Instead of the crazy 1440p 90 hertz oled of the pro it has their 20 watt charger. Instead of the crazy 30 watt warp charging, it has a regular vibration motor instead of the amazing one from the pro, and it has a healthy, six or eight gigs of ram instead of an absolutely massive up to 12 and has one less camera, it drops the Ultra wide and it's just the standard camera and the telephoto I wish they had kept the standard and the ultra wide like the s10 II, since I believe the ultra wide is way more useful and more fun than a telephoto, and I feel like everyone's realizing this. In 2019, but that's not what they did, it's still a 2x. So, basically, you can think of this as either a stripped down 1 7 Pro or what I think is more accurate, a refreshed 1 60, and what they've done is kept a lot of the things that people liked about the 1 plus 60, which, by the way Was a pretty good phone one, my phone of the year last year and they've continued it in this one. So now it has the snapdragon 85 still the newest chip. It'S got that clean oxygen OS with frequent software updates and if you haven't already noticed this one is running the Android Q beta. So that's why it's got a little bit of a different look and the different buttons and quick settings etc. Oneplus phones are some of the only ones that can get the betas this early. The alert slider is still here awesome, as always, although forever isn't it's just a little bit smaller just a little bit, it has 6 or eight gigs of ram. Like I mentioned, it's not 12, but it's still more than the pixel, for example, can say right now and then the front speaker, grille and the speaker itself are a little bit bigger. It doesn't make a huge sound difference for music and videos, but low-key. It is a bigger target area to hold the phone up when making phone calls. So that's nice matter of fact, there are certain things to like more about the seven than the seven Pro for certain people. So, for example, it's a smaller phone and plenty of people, including me, felt the 7 Pro is just a little bit on the big side. So the size of the seven is more comfortable in the hand, more pocketable, easy to reach the tops and corners things like that. There'S not that many compact flagships, you know, and it's a flat display instead of a curved one, that sort of bleeds over the edges. I talked about this in the 7 / review, I'm not the biggest fan of the curved glass and the extra glare and the accidental touches that I'll come with that. So I'm pretty happy with the flat display and then just little things like it's a little bit more likely to be water-resistant thanks to the complete lack of moving parts, no pop up camera, so no worries about durability and of course the phone is cheaper, starts at 500 pounds so the 1 6 t t EK, 1. 7. I feel like if one post only released this phone this year and no 1 7 Pro we'd all still kind of know. This is obviously an incremental improvement over last year, but that wouldn't be such a bad thing, because we already know the 1 60 was already a great phone, but so many other things have happened in the phone world in just the past couple months that this relatively Minor improvement just got really easy to fall under the radar. You can't also get it to stand out or look a bit different if you want, with a skin from our channel sponsor D brand, if you want to also since they don't make any matte black version of this phone this year, you got to take that upon Yourself to get rid of fingerprints, and speaking of take it upon yourself, if you really do want to import this phone, you have to take it upon yourself and pay a little extra for the shipping to get it to your region and make sure the band's work With your carrier of choice and all that which they usually do, but it's worth checking so if you just search 1 7 on Google or YouTube or anything like that, you will get bombarded with 1 7 Pro photos and videos and articles and everything it's so easy To forget that this one plus seven exists: why what? Why did this phone fall so far under the radar? Well, there are two main reasons, one that I love and one that I don't love so much to start with the one. I don't love so much. This phone is so under the radar because that's where oneplus put it but they're not launching this phone in the u.s.. So it's focusing more heavily on Europe and Asia, but also oneplus is actively moving their brand positioning from straight-up budget to much more premium and part of that is attacking the higher margin higher price market. So not only is 1 7 Pro a great phone, but that's what it's doing for them: legitimizing their more expensive products, they're going from flagship killer to hey. We also make a flagship, fine, but the other reason it's under the radar is because everyone else is kind of putting it there. The competition is putting it there. There has never been more competition at this sort of premium mid to your price than there is right. Now Asus zenfone 6 Samsung a 70 redmi k20 pro pixel 3. A poco phone 2 is probably coming out soon it's lit. So this is your PSA that the 1 7 is an option to import for the price. But it's just that now it's an option. It'S not the clear front-runner anymore and it's got a whole bunch of very interesting competition in that little slot from like 300 to 600 dollars. That being said, I do still really like this phone there's a lot of things from that phone of the year that it takes and continues, and I can see myself using it every day and that's not something I say about every phone. So that says a lot about the 1 7 and it also represents that shift in priorities for oneplus as a company and just the markets in general, and it also represents a very crowded radar which, if you know what I know about competition is a good thing For all of us, thanks for watching get you guys the next one peace """
XnSqlX1kCQo,Google Pixel 3a Review: A for Ace!,9:01,"Hey what is up guys? I'M QB HD here pixel 3a, so you may have seen this guy in a whole. Bunch of commercials and ads recently they've been going hard with those campaigns and a lot of those are sort of hammering home. The same two points. One 399: that's the price starts at 399 bucks and 2. This phone has a better camera than others, fun fact, all the ads just say: pixel 3a and phone X. I could have sworn after seeing a bunch of these, some of them said iPhone X. You probably thought they said iPhone X, but no, they all just say phone X, but Google. We all know you're talking about the iPhone X and in the fine print it says image shot on the iPhone 10s. So why not just say pixel 3a vs. iPhone. Wouldn'T that make the point even more powerful anyway, so both those two initial things are true. It does start at 399 bucks, that's how much I paid for this one and it does have an excellent camera, one that's actually better than the iPhone which by itself is kind of amazing at this price point. But of course, there's more to this phone and I've been using it for about a week, so I'll tell you about it, so bring the phone down in price, as we know, is all about sacrifices and there's been a ton of focus on this camera. Naturally and I'll get to that, but there are a bunch of other things about this phone to consider best way to analyze. It, though, is still to compare it to its bigger brother, which is the $ 800 pixel 3. There aesthetically very similar. They even feel pretty much the same now. The pixel 3a is all plastic instead of glass, but they've actually done. I think a great job of making it feel similar to the touch and I could swear the plastic 3a is lighter when holding them next to each other, but the scale confirms they're pretty much the same weight to this purplish color is also kind of funny. It looks basically sort of pale lavender for most angles, but if the light hits it right, sometimes it looks more blue. Sometimes it looks more white. It really just depends on the environment you're in, but you do get that colored power button, which I appreciate and then the only place you're losing out on build quality of this cheaper phone is the lack of wireless charging and no water resistance, and then you actually Gained a headphone jack huh. Would you look at that? These budget phones just keep the headphone jack around, but other than that it still really feels like a pixel. Oh and I've also noticed the fingerprint reader on the back of the 3a, is a little bit more recessed than the three again here's the 3a and then the three pretty sure. That'S because the pixel three is all glass. So you have the glass fingerprint reader at the same level, but this is a plastic phone. You still need glass and the fingerprint reader, so they sort of indented it and I'm the only other main aesthetic difference is the display, which is what you're looking at most of the time so you're getting a slightly thicker bezel on both the top and bottom and The sides and the pixel 3a has a decidedly meh display it's a little bigger than the pixel three. It'S a five point: six inch 1080p OLED, but it doesn't get very bright to the point where it actually can be kind of tough to see it outdoors and then, even when you're in normal indoor environments, it looks fine when you're staring straight at it, but the Off-Axis color shift is noticeable. It starts to go cool and a little green earlier than normal. So the display quality itself to me was a downgrade, which is a big deal to me since I'm someone who pixel peeps and does a lot of photo editing and things like that on my phone. So if you do that too you'll notice and then the speaker has a bit cut off too so the pixel three, as we know, had dual front-facing stereo speakers, one of my favorite things about it. The pixel 3a still has that top speaker. So I'm glad to still have front-facing audio, but then down at the bottom chin is super empty and you have a single downward firing speaker at the bottom. That comes out of this grille. But what's funny is, if you take some magnet paper to the back, you can see. The speaker is all the way over on one side, and this is common on phones like the iPhone where the grille is just another resonance chamber for audio to come out. It turns out the sound, doesn't actually come out both sides. It'S just for show on the 3a. You can still easily block the one side that audio comes out. The bottom grille, but again at least it's still just half of the speaker pair. You still get audio coming out, the top so you're not totally blocking it and the speaker's get pretty loud and they sound fine. So the main concern many people have had, and rightfully so with the pixel 3a is just. Is it's low? A lot of budget phones? Nowadays or mid-range phones are still bringing the top high-end specs before they sacrifice with other things. Pixel 3a does not have top spec's, it has a snapdragon 670, the audrina 615 4 gigs of ram, and so if pixel 3 was already having performance issues. What'S this phone gon na be like well I'm here to tell you, after using this phone for a little while it performs kind of just like the pixel 3, meaning it's fine, it gets the job done. You will notice it's not as smooth as the higher end ones and it definitely struggles with RAM management. Still. There are apps closing in the background only 4 gigs of RAM, but it just kind of works. Fine, I don't know if maybe I'm even more critical, because I just came from the oneplus 7 Pro, which is the smoothest fastest phone I've ever used, but pixel 3a, just kind of feels like it chugs along, doesn't care too much about smoothness and just eventually does What you say so opening and closing apps and multitasking and opening files and editing photos all that stuff. It doesn't lag at all, it's just not as fast, but it's not too slow or unusable. It'S just fine, so this phone also has slower internal storage than other flagships, and I can tell in the speed of opening a lot of bigger, apps and bigger files. But you know it's not killing me and then one part of the performance of this phone that I can say actually does much better than its older brother is the battery life, because you're only pushing at 1080p display and lower power internals and this phone has killed. It with the battery life I've consistently got over 5 hours of screen on time, with the three a usually more and on heavy days. I could just barely kill it in a day. So this is refreshing because some phones in this budget class do you cut down on the battery some don't, but this one actually has physically larger batteries than the flagship brothers, so that was kind of nice to see battery life good on the 3a. So that just leaves the last part, the part that Google knows they have on lock the cameras on the pixel. So the 3a has the exact same hardware for the single rear camera same sensor same glass. Same oh, is, and everything on the front, though you go from dual front facing cameras, one ultra wide and one standard to a single selfie camera, that's sort of in-between. So it's a little wider than normal, but it's not quite the full ultra wide. So it's a good compromise, but in this rear camera this is the reason to get hyped over. This phone, of course, photos from a3. A are very detailed and have tons of dynamic range and great color taking pictures with it. It'S so easy to forget: it's a form $ 4 phone, because no other budget phone takes photos anywhere near this good, especially in the more challenging lighting scenarios so like shooting directly into the Sun or I'm darker lighting. Things like that. It'S no question: night sight is still on another level. Now something else to note. The pixel 3a does not have the dedicated image, processing, chip or pixel visual core that the flagship has. So what does that mean? Basically that now it's processing images on the snapdragon 670? Instead, I found that this has almost zero effect on the actual final image quality. Really, the only thing you'll notice for sure is photos take a little longer to actually process after you, snap, the photo that's about it. So overall, if pixel 3 is image is an A then. This is an a and that's still miles ahead of any other camera of any phone in this price range. So should you buy a pixel 3a, of course this is gon na, be a really good phone. At the price for a lot of people, but it's not just as simple as saying oh, it's just like the pixel, but cheaper. It'S just a little more nuance than that. There are a lot of other competitive phones out around at this price. Now, more than ever before, you have that zenfone 6. That just came out at 500 bucks, but that's pretty nice. You have the oneplus 60 and the oneplus 7 out there, the galaxy s 9 coming down in price from last year. So there's a lot of happening. The pixel 3 8 chops down in a couple places where some other mid-range phones wouldn't have so it doesn't have the super high-end specs and it's just never gon na feel blazing fast and, of course, no wireless charging and no water resistance. We know that, but it does bring down a lot of those things from higher-end phones like its Big Brother, that we love so much like that same fingerprint reader on the back, the same squeeze for a cysteine is still there. The same really good haptic motor, which is underrated for stuff like typing and notifications, the same super smart software experience that will be updated first in line and an even better battery life and then, of course, the best camera quality of any phone. So there are other things that are more important to some people than just the camera, in which case there's a whole world of other phones in this world that you can look into like I mentioned, but if you're in it for the best possible photo quality and The absolute best software experience for 400 bucks you're looking at it right here, pixel 3, a simple as that. So there you have it thanks for watching, get you guys the next one peace """
6C_4Bz62b0E,Samsung Galaxy Fold Review: We Gotta Talk!,15:21,"You [ Applause ]. This has got to be the weirdest set of circumstances. I'Ve ever had to review a phone like little-known fact: I've I've dropped and scratched an unreleased phone before I even got to shoot any footage of it. I'Ve had software updates dramatically changed the way I felt about a phone in the middle of shooting. The review so weird stuff has happened behind the scenes, but this is this is a lot, so I want hands on with the phone for the first time, then I dropped my video on the first impressions of it. Then I went home with one and then I broke it and then I got replaced and then I found out all the reviewers had theirs break for similar related reasons made a whole video about that. And now this device is getting delayed and Samsung is actually going to change it before it actually comes out and ships to people who bought it. So this is the Samsung Galaxy fold kinda it's it's the part, one. The pre review, there's an official statement from Samsung saying they'll, be strengthening the display and it'll be a little bit different when it actually comes out and gets released. But until then this is more of a review of the rest of the execution. On this whole foldable phone concept, so right off the bat, I love that this is it's just so different. I mean we're so used to the slab, the glass front and back that when you have a whole new form factor, there's just so much more to talk about to think about. So let's talk about it. So one of the earliest thoughts that's floated around in my head about the Galaxy fold. Is it's more like a folding tablet than a folding phone? So you have this little baby 4.7 inch display on the outside. With I mean, let's be honest, comically big bezels and even that number it makes the screen seem bigger than it is with the rounded corners it even says, on the box, it's basically a 4.6 inch display and then even with that, it's much narrower than normal. So it feels like the same width as a three point: six inch display all that to say it's small. So what you want to do is open it up and use the 7.3 inch four by three OLED display. That'S on the inside. That'S where the magic happens. That'S the whole point of this foldable phone evolution is fitting a display this big in your pocket still so the galaxy fold. This version of it is definitely chunky like this is a thick phone with maybe three or four C's. It doesn't fold completely flat, as you can see, there's a gap in the middle of mine with a hinge. All of them have this sort of a triangle shape and then yeah, the more you look at it. The more it sort of reminds me of two narrow phones connected to each other from a lot of angles like it has the weight of two phones. It fits in your pocket like two phones, it's really a lot of material, so it turns out. This is a fragile phone and you can tell it as soon as you pick it up like it's pretty fragile and that's because of really two main pieces, the hinge and the soft plastic on the inside. So of course, glass doesn't fold, make a folding phone. You need something other than glass, so you have plastic on this outside and then, of course you need a hinge somewhere, and this hinge from Samsung is this crazy, complex mechanism with gears and this big cover over the back and it's a scary piece, because there's speculation That dirt and dust can slide its way into this hinge through the gears and all the way up into the phone behind the display, which may have caused a review unit to break which is pretty crazy, but that will hopefully change with the updated version. So I don't want to spend too much time on that, but what I will say is even though it's rated for 200,000 folds by a robot in a lab I mean you can literally wobble this thing with your bare hands like there's give to this hinge. I am literally terrified for the jerryrigeverything test when he finally gets his because I'd bet money. It'S just gon na snap in half like I'd, bet real money on that, but you got to have a hinge. So there is one here and then the other delicate piece is a soft plastic screen, and this is the part that Samsung had the most difficulty with with all the review units. That is the part that they're definitely changing on the updated version of this phone, but even if they do make it stronger, it's still gon na be just one of the weak points of this first generation folding phone. Just because that's where material science and tech is right now, so one of the biggest questions about the Galaxy fold unfolded is yeah. How bad is that crease? You know how bad is it? Can you see it pretty much? Everyone who's watched, a video of the Galaxy fold, has just stared at that crease, so something I've noticed about that. It seems like, and you can look this up. It feels like pretty much everyone complaining about. The crease is people who don't have one that are watching a video of the crease and just noticing it, and then people who do have one are mostly saying it's not a huge deal. I fall somewhere in the middle because obviously like kind of like a notch, if you stare at it, of course, it looks horrible and you're gon na notice that absolutely - and this one has a notch too. But this crease, like if you're in a brightly, lit environment or if you have a light wallpaper, that's something you're gon na see. That'S why Samsung has a black wallpaper by default on this phone. But for me, when you're looking at the phone straight on and you're focused on the content, you know whatever game or video you're in and what you're watching. I don't see the crease at all. So then I'm super immersed and it looks fantastic. But then I'll look at it off access for like a second or I'll catch my finger running over it too many times like even when the phone's flat, you can feel it, and then you remember it's there and it's not so hot. So the mild crease is just one of those things that you're gon na have to accept in a first-generation folding phone. That'S just part of the tech. The Galaxy fold shares a lot of things with the Galaxy S 10. A lot of the good parts actually which make it feel a little less first-gen, so it has the same high-end, specs, snapdragon, a 55 12 gigs of ram and then materials. Of course. So the glass and the metal everywhere and the speakers are actually a bit better than the s10, so you have the ones at the bottom and the ones at the top, and it actually creates a sort of a stereo speaker separation. So there you go a hidden advantage of having a gigantic device. Is the speakers are so far apart and can have so much room that they're actually better than normal, closer to a tablet? Speaker, that's cool and then, of course you have mainly the same software as the s10. 2 1 UI is still doing a good job as far as reach ability and organization, responsiveness, etc. It'S pretty good. I have had a couple of random weird bugs with the fold, though like Spotify lockscreen, music controls haven't worked at all for me, which is kind of weird, because I use them all the time, and I had this weird app drawer overlap, bug that only a restart Of the device fixed other than that, though, it's been pretty solid and then there are two main software features added to the fold multitasking, which is a little adjusted and continuity multitasking for me, wasn't a huge deal mainly because I've had multitasking on big phones before on This huge screen on the fold you can have three apps side-by-side in this triple window and then you can keep adding floating windows up to eight apps open at once, and the 12 gigs of ram handles it. Fine but again, like I'm a person who will probably just stick to two at once, and I feel like it's great in this nearly square format, because now it's feeling like two full size phones next to each other again. But continuity, though, that is a core feature of a folding phone going from the small to the large and back to the small again, and it's worked in the Galaxy fold better than I've seen in any other folding phone demo. So I was impressed by continuity and it was fast, so you have an app open on the small screen you want to get into it. So you open up the fold it opens up and it picks up right where you left off. So the apps that are supported best, basically, the ones from Google and Samsung right now, will be the best at remembering everything about your small screen state and transferring it perfectly and then with some other apps. There will be a kind of a reset timeline or scrolling which can be kind of annoying and then in the very few apps that don't support it at all. Going from the small screen to the big screen will give you a blown-up version of the phone screen and then you'll have to hit this button in the corner to restart the app to get the new aspect ratio. From my experience, it was a surprising amount of apps pretty much all the apps I use, except for a youtube studio, worked in some way with continuity, which was cool so by default. When you close the fold, it just goes to sleep just because that's usually what you're doing when you close it you're going to sleep and you're done using it. But there is a setting that will allow you to continue using apps from the big screen to the small screen. So in the display settings it's called continued apps on front screen. So you can turn that on too. If you go in there and check like Google Maps or accurate weather, for example, then you have an app open on the big screen. You close the fold and it'll wake up where you left off on the smaller screen. This will also continue to get better with Android cue, as Google and Samsung continue to work on it, but it's already pretty impressive to me. It'S already miles better than the barely functional real flex pay. I saw at CES okay, so the rest of my thoughts on the Galaxy fold are, I guess, pretty random, but let's talk about it so opening the fold in general is clumsy with these magnets and these buttons and how thick the phone is. It'S constantly a bit of a battle for me closing it is easy, you just slap it shut and it's fine, but opening it always like you have to pry it apart and I feel like I just never got used to that. It'S always a two-handed action. The bezels on the front screen yeah, they are super ugly, but I'm also pretty sure. Samsung knows this too, like this is not what they would have wanted to make. They would have rather made a bezel as if they could so that leads me to believe they were kind of forced to make it like this. Maybe the tech in the hinge in other parts rink the front screen down pretty bad there's an I fix that tear down, but that's suddenly gone, but that's what I believe the battery of the fold is fantastic. It is split in half like I've said so, there's a cell in each half of this phone that add up to four thousand three hundred eighty milliamp hours and I've had great battery life on the fold, which is really impressive, considering something with so much screen and Then I got to say this phone might have been even more awesome with an S Pen right up the side. Obviously, since it can't fold, of course, but I'm guessing there isn't enough space for that, and it's not even a Galaxy Note fold, but I'm just you know imagining how dope would it be to pop it open, take notes on that huge screen and then just close It just a thought: the Samsung default keyboard is actually split when you open the phone. I actually prefer this Google keyboard and I've been using it and it's not split, but I suspect that people with smaller hands will appreciate the default split keyboard, design and the Galaxy fold is super awkward as a GPS in your car. So you don't want to use it with the tiny four point, whatever inch screen, but when folded open it's way too wide for any of those clamping, car mounts or even a cup holder or anything so yeah, someone's gon na, have to make a sort of specialized Car mount for this thing that holds it unfolded, so you can use the nav as a big screen. The Bigsby button, underneath the fingerprint reader is the worst I'm convinced Samsung was like. Oh, we can just put the Bigsby button in there quietly and they won't even notice it because they'll be so focused on the fold. Yeah. No I'm talking about it. Samsung, it's not it's not the move. It'S straight-up route, just the form factor of the Galaxy fold unfolding it so many times, you're gon na accidentally press that button constantly - and you know we don't want to use big speed, but hey they dropped it in there. So at least you can turn it from being a single press to a double press to open Bixby. So there are less accidental triggers of your favorite voice assistant and then actually agree with a lot of what dieter from the verge was saying in his review about the front screen. Of course it's super small and because it's so bad looking most people won't want to use it most of the time. I'M doing something quick on it like taking a phone call or music controls or messing with podcasts, or just something quick that you can use on. The small screen and then put it back away, but you know those times where you just take out your phone, do one quick thing and then suddenly it's 15 minutes later and you're just mindlessly scrolling through Instagram yeah. That doesn't really happen on this front screen. So it doesn't really happen on this phone. The screen is so small. You don't really want to do anything on it. So anytime, you want to really get into something or get some work done. You have this intentional opening the fold action and then you're using it. Then you're getting work done or whatever you were gon na do when you're done, you close it up and you don't really ever have those like getting lost moments of wandering around on that small screen. It'S interesting. So, at the end of the day, like I said in that broken video, I was never really gon na recommend people go out and buy the two thousand dollar generation one galaxy fold why you may ask well for a two in one or a convertible, whatever you Want to call this to actually be worth it in any category. It generally needs to either be better than or cheaper than having to get both things in that category, so for all those crazy laptops that fold backwards and have a touchscreen in there, these two and one convertibles, those are trying to be both a laptop and a Tablet and a lot of those are specialized at being a better laptop than most or being a better tablet than most or they're just straight-up, cheaper than buying both a laptop and a tablet. The galaxy fold is trying to be a phone and a tablet, but it's not a better phone than most and it's not a better tablet than most and a two thousand bucks. It sure, as hell isn't cheaper than just buying a Galaxy S. Ten and a tablet. So yeah, I'm not gon na, tell you to buy it, but what I will tell you to do is when these actually do start showing up in stores go into a store and try it like pick it up. Hold it unfold. It close it like get that feeling of actually having this huge screen that you can fit in your pocket as a concept folding your tablet and being able to put it in your pocket. That'S that's the main advantage. That'S what will make these better than most tablets and then the fact that it can be a phone on top of that, too, is a nice bonus, so I like the concept, but this is of course generation 1 of what I to now believe after using it That this will be the future of smartphones or the future of, or both you know, this clamshell design reminds me of this. Is this right here is everything the LG Voyager ever wanted to be like this, this right here with the all touchscreen and if phones can get as good as they did in the last 12 years from the LG Voyager till now, then I'm pretty excited for what Smartphones are gon na turn into from this first gen folding phone over the next couple of years. So I'm thankful for Samsung willing to jump in early and get it started to everyone hating on the Galaxy fold. I get it it's so easy. It'S really easy to see a phone like this come along and it's 2,000 bucks and it's got this hinge down the middle, and I know it's been tough to like find real big flaws with phones lately. So when you see something like this, oh you got a dive in this is your time to shine. This is this is the one to hate on, but for those of us that actually get excited about new technology. This is one of the few truly new form factors and and new first gen concepts in a long time, and for it to have this much promise. This early is actually pretty exciting. It'S pretty cool, there's gon na have to be a part two of this review with final hardware, when that's eventually a thing, but until then I'm gon na send this back to Samsung, I'm gon na. Let them work on it. I'M gon na cross my fingers until it gets good, then until then thanks for watching catch, you guys later peace, """
TI4PXFUOPR8,Samsung Galaxy S10e Review: Why Not?,7:14,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kip EHD here - and this is the Samsung Galaxy S 10 II, with a lowercase e little note. The e stands for officially and the Galaxy S 10. It might not be a better phone on paper than the S 10 and s 10 plus, but I can definitely say now that I've used it that it is a better deal. It'S kind of a direct answer to the iPhone 10 are they're, not hiding that in any way like it's the same price but hardware wise, it's kind of a step up in every direction that isn't battery. So it kind of got me thinking why not just get the S 10 e, so the best way to explain the S 10. You use to tell you, what's different versus the regular S 10 I'll link the S 10 review right here or below the like button for those who haven't seen it already, but it's a very similar phone. This is everything that's different, so the big three are the cameras, the fingerprint reader, the new display and the price. It'S 750 bucks. Now, by the way, I feel like. We need a new name for this, like this $ 750 price, because it's not budget, but it's above mid-range still, but it's also below flagships like the flagships are like $ 900,000. So it's above mid-range. So it's like a premium mid-range like a mid-range premium. Okay, so the cameras s10 II has the exact same primary camera and the exact same ultra wide camera as the s10. It'S just missing the extra telephoto camera. Honestly, that's been totally fine. I don't really miss it at all. Zoomed in photos will now be digital zoom. Instead of switching to the telephoto camera - and that's alright with me and keeping the ultra wide camera is sweet. That'S the new camera for the Samsung phones this year and, like I said in the review, it's by far the most fun. It is still a bit softer and a bit more over processed in those photos than the main camera, definitely not as crispy, but this is something software updates will continue to improve. So that's that with the camera other than that same really, good camera, as we've had in the s10. So then the fingerprint reader instead of an ultrasonic fingerprint reader underneath the glass. This s10 has a good old, classic capacitive fingerprint reader on the our button on the right side of the phone and coming back from the s10 to using this again man. It'S really easy to forget how good we got at this type of fingerprint reader. It kind of became the gold standard before we started moving on from them and we wanted all the screen space, so we started putting them on the back of the phone on the side, but these fingerprint readers are really fast. This one here on the s10 II is just about one of the fastest fingerprint readers I've ever used, and there are others that are this fast, but it just feels so much faster. Coming from the s, tens all true sonic reader. It is way faster than that. Now for placement, it is in the power button on the top right hand, side, but the power button is still also kind of high up on the side of this phone. Now, since the phone is smaller, it's not as big of a deal and with bigger hands. It'S even less of a big deal, but just a little bit lower of a button that would have been perfect. So the reader is basically in a natural resting position for righties or for people who hold the phone in their right hand, and on top of that, there's even a gesture in the settings that you can turn on where you can now swipe down to pull down The notification shade so that the favorite reader becomes a sort of a gesture pad and it's super responsive, maybe even too sensitive. You can sort of do it by accident, a bunch if you're, not careful, but once you get used to it. It'S super useful to not have to reach up to the top of the phone every single time. So basically you pick up the phone and you just sort of hold it in a natural resting position, get instantly unlocks, and then you have access to the notifications. Just like that, I mean it's not as technologically cool as the under glass ultrasonic fingerprint reader, but you could argue it's actually better than what you get on the s10 and some already have. So that brings us to the last but not least, important difference the display. So the s10 has the smallest display in the new lineup. It'S a 5.8 inch screen. It'S still weird to call a 5.8 inch display small, but it's true and it's still dynamic, AMOLED still a sharp high resolution. It'S 20 to 80 by 1080, still has a hole. Punch cut out in the top corner that makes for amazing wallpapers, of course, and still super bright and color accurate as you'd expect from a Samsung panel. The difference is it's flat, so it's a flat screen now, instead of bleeding over the edges. So with that, you end up with slightly thicker more noticeable side bezels, but like barely and it's all relative still look next to an iPhone 10s. Remember Apple had all that talk about curving the OLED display to get the chin thinner and to get the edges all really close s. 10 e has the same sized side bezels and the chin, maybe two or three millimeters taller. So that's the esthetic difference. Also, one thing I noticed is the S 10 e. Doesn'T let you choose your displays screen resolution like the bigger s, 10 does and I'm not actually sure why I would guess it has something to do with the pentile display matrix they're using, but either way it's kind of set and forget out the box anyway, and It looks great so, assuming you don't hate the hole punch, this is still a fantastic display, other little things, six gigs of ram in the base model, instead of eight, not really a huge deal. I think it was if it was for you know, thanks to my concerns with the pixel. I would probably be also concerned about this, but six gigs of RAM still seems like enough and you get eight on the upgraded model. So it's pretty close. Oh, the battery is slightly smaller, its 3100 milliamp hours instead of the larger ones on the larger phones, but it's also a smaller display. As you know, that's the biggest power draw, so this is still a pretty great battery life phone and then the color. So as long as we're drawing parallels to the iPhone 10 are, you might have noticed, the es10 has a bit more color than the s 10. So there's the glass on the back. This is flamingo pink. So if you're, the type to rock your phone naked, you can enjoy having an extremely bright phone, even honestly, even the red monstro sensor and all my coloring ability through your screen, probably won't do it justice, it's really pink, but not only that the aluminum rails are Colorized a little bit so you have matching sides, it's more toned down than the back, but you can see it from the sides of the phone and then even in the camera module, unlike the s10, they colored that metal in there as well. So it's a small touch black on the s10 color on the s10 II, but that that's basically it for this phone. Those are the differences for 750 bucks so again on paper. Is that a better phone? No, but it is a better deal matter of fact, feature for feature as far as hardware, what you get and with a much better display and a headphone jack, and all these other things ultra wide camera. I think it's a better deal than the iPhone 10 are now for a lot of people that won't even matter because they just want another iPhone, but if you're not too tied into the ecosystem yet or if you're looking to get out of it, then why not? That'S tiny! Okay: here you should buy the bigger higher-end phone if you need the ultrasonic fingerprint reader or the infinity display, or the 2x telephoto camera or if you just have a bigger $ 200 hole burning in your pocket other than that galaxy s. 10A is probably the one most people should get either way. That'S been it thanks for watching catch, you guys in the next one peace. """
I65jo06QinI,Sony WH1000XM3 Review: A New ANC King!,7:53,"Okay, what is up guys, I'm Q PhD here and I'm in Seattle right now for a top-secret project that you guys will see soon, but over the past couple days and for my trip to get here and so on. I'Ve been testing a certain pair of new headphones, so you guys may have seen the pictures you may have seen the tweets. It is already my new all-time favorite pair of wireless noise, cancelling cans. This is over the bose QC 35. 2 s. This is over the Microsoft Surface, headphones, it's the Sony, WH 1000 X and threes, terrible name, but these are the real deal honestly, there's really not all that much. You have to do to really nail a pair of this category of over ear noise cancelling headphones. So you've got to sound great, you have to have good noise cancellation and then you just have to be somewhat comfortable and have a fairly good feature set and, as you might imagine, since I'm talking about him like this, these male all of those so right off. The bat with the sound these sound, excellent they're, full rich and clear, with the sound they have more range and more deep bass than the Bose, but without being overwhelming and short of studio headphones. This is a great sounding crisp, clean pair of drivers and the noise cancellation is actually a bit better than the Bose. I was already sacrificing a little bit when I switched to surface headphones. I think those surface headphones had slightly worse, sound and slightly worse, active noise cancellation, but I loved the design and the comfort and USB type-c and the dials, and all of that, so that put them over the top. For me, these Sony's, though sound better than both, are better at noise cancellation than both and they have a great design. Basically, as soon as I heard these, I knew I liked them and they've been sort of growing on me ever since, and also I wore these for five and a half hours straight on the flight to get here, and they only really started to get tight by The end of those five and a half hours so design wise. I think these are kind of great and that's something. Bose has always been king at these are lightweight like those the cups have a good amount of padding. The top band is padded. There are plenty flexible enough to not be squeezing your head all the time and getting uncomfortable, and then they beat the bows by being USB type-c. It'S actually funny a lot of people see these and immediately think this. This copper accent at the top and it looks like the USBC port, but it's not that's. Actually the microphone at the top of both ear cups. The USBC port is down here at the bottom, but yeah you can use the same charger as you already have for your phone or your laptop or whatever other USB, see things you have, and the battery life lives up to the 20 plus hours longer than the Surface headphones, it's great okay! I'M really raving about these! I'M making them sound. Pretty perfect trust me, though, they're not perfect, nothing's perfect, I think in an ideal world I would combine these with the surface headphones and their their dials and their design. I think those those function a little bit better, but here are some things about these that aren't quite perfect. First of all, my number one complaint is the controls. There are only two physical buttons on these all the rest of the controls. All the rest of the work is all done by swiping and tapping on the right ear cup, which is a small touchpad, so double tap to play and pause swiping up and down to change the volume and forward and backward to change tracks. It can be a bit fidgety, it doesn't work every time, but you kind of get used to it. Another thing is: when you take the headphones off, they just keep playing like normal headphones, but the surface headphones would detect when you took them off your head and they'd pause and when you put them back on, they would keep playing again. These don't - and I kind of miss that and then the two buttons that are physical on these are the power button and the noise cancellation / ambient mode switch which by default, doubles as the Google assistant button. So you can hold it to speak and talk to Google assistant, which is cool without ever you know, taking your phone out your pocket, you can ask Google assistant a question out loud and it'll answer that question. It can also read your notifications when you ask it to, but even with all of that, I still prefer the surface headphones physical dials still for volume, and then there is also what is known as the cold weather issue. With these headphones, there been a couple reports about it or articles about it, but basically, when you take these out in you know freezing conditions or sub-zero weather, apparently the touch pads will start to register phantom touches. So without you ever touching them it'll start to play and pause your muse and change the volume and the tracks and randomly stop playing that's pretty rough. Now I have been using these outside. You know as low as 40 degrees Fahrenheit, so not below freezing, but I haven't had this issue yet to with as cold as it is in some parts of the world right now, it's worth noting that these do seem to have that issue, and I don't know If it can be fixed with a software update, it may be possible, but as of right now, if there's a cold weather issue that makes these unusable in certain climates, that's kind of a bummer, so I have to let you guys know about it. Also, these headphones come with a good hard case, like most other over your headphones, but I find that the way they fold is really annoying. Maybe it's just that I haven't gotten used to it yet, but that's a small nitpick honestly, the case itself is fine and if wind or anything blows hard enough down on you from above the mics on the top will pick that up and you'll hear it as A sort of a fuzzy static. I only notice this because when I'm on the airplane, which is where a lot of people will listen to these, I had the vents above me and they were blowing down like directly into those microphones. So you just kind of adjust that anger. Fine, oh and the left ear cup has an NFC logo on it that can be used to tap to pair on the side of the headphones with an NFC naval device. So that's pretty cool I'm gon na start using that more often to connect or to disconnect, but these headphones only pair to one device at a time and that might not sound like a big deal. But when you get used to headphones with multiple device, connectivity and seamless, switching, that is a big time convenience. With these surface headphones or any other pair of headphones, that supports multiple devices. You can be playing something like literally music from your phone on the headphones pull out your iPad, which is already paired to the headphones and hit play on some video or Netflix, or whatever you're doing and it'll instantly take over on the headphones and there's seamless. Switching back and forth between devices without dealing with the frustration of Bluetooth. With these, you still have to deal with the pain of Bluetooth, sometimes being kind of fidgety and not connecting on the first try and having to do it again, and the whole pairing process is kind of annoying, so yeah just. I hope the next version of these that they make the m4s have that multiple device connectivity, but these don't I wish they did. I really missed that, but other than that, I I love these headphones they're matte black, mostly all the way around which you know. I love, but you also got this little copper accent at the top with the sony logo and the microphones, and it's also on the zipper of the hard case. So how they look is great. How they sound is great how they feel is great they're ideal for flying, of course, and they're also the go to pick for just travel headphones in general and and they're just great for cancelling out the noise of an office or a coffee shop, or really anywhere That noise canceling headphones are good, so yeah, that's that's pretty much all there is to say about headphones. I'M just glad these ended up on my radar. So shout out to those of you who are leaving comments on the videos shoutout to vipre for yelling at me. On his livestream to go, buy these shout out to everyone in the comment section of my last headphones video that got me to actually pick these up and i'm glad i'm using them now. These are now permanent, backpack material, so i'll drop a link below. If you guys want to check these out for yourself I'll leave a link to the other headphone video, but that's basically it thanks for watching. I'M gon na go back to working on that secret project. Now catch you guys in the next one peace. """
MdqKJxyIecE,Huawei Mate 20 Pro Review: The People's Choice!,9:25,"Hey, what's up guys of kabhi HD here and a little do you know? For the past week I've been using this guy as my daily driver. So the day after 1:00, my blind smartphone camera test. I figured you know what it's legitimately the People's Choice. So I might as well give it a shot. It is not coming to the u.s. officially, but I'm gon na try it anyway. So I put my sim card in the huawei mate 20 Pro, and this is the last phone to be reviewed before the smartphone Awards and this one's been getting a lot of hype. I got ta say I did that first impressions, video, when it first came out that I sort of laid off it and it slowly started racking up phone of the Year awards and it was people's Cop choices for 2018. So I brought it back out the won. The contest, so I got ta, try it and I got ta say I like it quite a bit now I don't love it and that that's really only because of one thing, but I like it a lot. So here's why yeah we're off the bat while we've really leveled up their design game with this phone? I think the hardware is on point it's kind of closer to Samsung design, actually than anything with the shape of the phone. The glass on both sides curving over the sides, they're really thin rails. This is gon na be a slippery phone without a case on it. So I'm warning you that right now, but it does have a slight texture like this subtle raised pattern in the glass. It'S kind of hard to describe, but it makes this sound when you drag your fingernails across it. I actually like it to fix the slipperiness, though you might be better off, covering it up with a skin from our channel sponsor addy brand. Personally, I think going with the red on the back, even though it's a little loud, it matches the red power button pretty well, but they have plenty of other options as well so of reds too loud for you I'll link the rest of those below. But anyway, yes, I love the colored power button, that's a strong move right there and then the triple cameras plus the flash on the back kind of look like bug eyes, but I think in the middle it looks fine and since the power and volume buttons are All on one side, the left is totally smooth and blank, but yeah overall, it just feels in the hand like a galaxy s. 9 has a baby with an iPhone meaning you get mostly Samsung design features and then that knotch and then there's an IR blaster at the top. If you're into that, I haven't had an IR blaster and a phone in a really long time. But these used to be super useful ip68 water resistance check, USB C port check in glass, fingerprint reader check thin bezels check, speaker grille no check, so the speaker is actually behind the USB C port in this phone. So there's no other speaker grille. It seems like a cool idea for about five seconds, but then it turns out to be a horrible idea, like the speaker's themselves. Aren'T that bad, it's the one in the earpiece and on the one at the bottom, behind the port, but putting it behind the USB C port makes it extremely easy to block the whole thing by accident. At any time, and even though I do mostly while I was charging with this phone, how do you expect it to sound when you're plugged in its muffled all the time, so this figure behind the port was not the move? Otherwise, though all-around great hardware - and then you get a great display at the front too, so a six point, four inch OLED and it's 31 20 by 1440. So super sharp and it gets plenty bright in daylight and, like I said it has this Samsung look so shape sort of curves over on both sides and then the back does it too, and it also has a notch up top which again at this point I Don'T really mind anymore: almost every phone has one of some sort, plus you get all the same face ID sensors so at least are using that space well for something, but the weird part is on the size of the display. There'S this little bit of light fall-off like it gets a bit darker and discolored on the very edges in a way that I don't think I see really on samsung phones and there's also a pretty obvious color shift off axis. Like some other ohlet's, it's a pretty good display, but it's not perfect and then performance is great. Now again, since it's not coming to the US you'll notice. This is one of the few phones. That'S not rocking a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, it's actually the Kirin 980. So it's a seven nanometer chip and there's six gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage and it's pretty smooth for the most part, I'd say on par with any Samsung phone like an s9 or something no problems with multitasking opening and closing apps, etc. Where the chip really shines, however, is definitely battery life. The best part of this mate 20 pro 100 %, is not the camera, it is the battery. So it's a 4200 milliamp hour cell, even though the phone is not that thick and why weighs power management is pretty aggressive about trying to save power. It'S changing the resolution of the screen when you're not using it much it's pretty pretty active about killing apps in the background, but the result has been by far the best battery life in any phone I've used this year. This has been a two-day phone for me. A couple times I don't get to say that much so that's really impressive. A lot of the other flagships this year that had the best battery life for my heavy use, we're getting like 5 to 6 hours of screen on time, which is really impressive. May 20 protein a where I ended with four and a half hours of screen on time at about 1 a.m. and there was 58 % battery left Wow. I really do not ever think about charging this phone there's constantly more battery than I need. I usually end with 6 7 hours of screen on time before I have to charge, and when I do, I pop it on the wireless charger it's unreal. This is a no one can convince me, this isn't an a-plus-plus battery life phone and it also has this head-turning feature reverse wireless charging. It is a gimmick that all pretty much never use, but it also hilarious and amazing and I'm glad it works and I'm glad they did it basically an extremely useful troll for people, and you also get to offer them a charge. But of course, the most hyped part about this phone was the camera and for good reason. So I rock and triple cameras on the back with a flash. You get a 40 megapixel main sensor, an 8 megapixel telephoto sensor and a 20 megapixel super wide angle. Those are big-boy numbers honestly to me with the results. It'S an a-minus camera, meaning it's pretty good, almost great, but not quite the best. I definitely sticks to what won the blind contest, which is bright. Photos pictures from the may 20 Pro are often very bright, sometimes overexposed, but it has good enough dynamic range to not lose a bunch of highlight detail and are basically never any shadows. Now the detail on the sharpness, our A which I love to see and the colors were a bit muted at times, so there's definitely a different sort of color science with this Huawei processing, but really when there's a lot of light. There'S just no contrast. Absolutely no shadows, no blacks when you get down to low-light, it holds up pretty well, though, and this with the night mode a little bit as well, which did better noise reduction. But really the best part about the camera is just the extra focal lengths. Having that super wide angle, camera sometimes is pretty cool. The telephoto yeah less useful to me, but I'm glad it's there, but really it's just all-around super versatile and I don't think anyone capable of a little photo editing will really hate it and also it's probably gon na end up the highest ever DxO mark score again. If they ever review it, so if you care about that there you go so clearly. There are a lot of reasons to like this phone, but I said at the beginning: there was something that didn't quite measure up and for me, that's the software, so this phone runs emui on top of android pi. So i'm glad it's. The latest version of android and has all kinds of quirks and usability things. Some of them are nice, some of them you may like, but others, I'm really not into I'll, be real. I had to put a little extra work to get it just the way I want. So I installed a Nova Launcher. I uninstalled a bunch of other duplicate apps, some others don't go away, so I have to disable them or hide them. I changed the keyboard. I change the default apps all kinds of stuff like that sort of built my way into it. It takes more work for some phones for others, but I got it the way I wanted and I've been using it and then there's just a lot of bugs. So the multitasking one is my personal least favorite. Every time I try to open the second most recent app with one tap. It just closes multitasking, not sure why it does that, and I hate it because that's something I want to do all the time, but it won't. Let me the notification tray also is always filled up, even when I have no notifications. So if I get one or two I don't know which ones they are and what order they are. Unless I open the tray and scroll down through them pour ease of the notch there and you can disable the knotch, but as well, doesn't fix that problem and there's still all the blatant copying of iOS. This share sheet with Huawei share, instead of airdrop. Still all that bloatware duplicate apps, all of that, so I'm still not a fan of the Mui that hasn't changed, but everything else about this phone is really damn good. The only downsides that I can point to about the actual physical hardware or the speaker, like I mentioned, and the in glass fingerprint reader, is a little bit slow, just like the other first gen ones that are out right now. Hopefully, that will get faster, but the rest of the phone is very complete. I think I would love this phone with oxygen, OS or even pixels, like stock Android with a bunch of those features, but either way. This is still the best phone Huawei's ever made hands down better than p20 pro, and if you don't mind paying the premium and importing it, then this is worth a look. Definitely worth checking out either way. That'S pretty much it! I guess now that we've reviewed this last phone. We can dive into the smartphone Awards for 2018. That'S upcoming either way thanks for watching catch, you guys in the next one peace """
e7sw5xA066Y,2018 Macbook Air Review: No Risk!,7:03,"Hey what's up guys into Bhd here, so this is basically what I do on my laptop write: a lot of email, a lot of texts and research-based stuff. A lot of Google Docs a lot of youtubing. So that's watching videos commenting on them and then all the YouTube studio stuff then some light photo editing. So I use Lightroom for that. It'S never more than one image at a time. It'S making adjustments and exporting pretty simple there and then a bunch of miscellaneous file management. You know downloading a bunch of images, editing documents signing PDFs things like that. I actually stopped video editing on my laptop and it's nice to have Final Cut Pro and be able to toss something together once in a while in 1080p tops, but for the videos you see on this channel that are 8k with all the transcoding and raw and Everything I refuse to put myself through rendering on a laptop, so I don't do that. So, basically, for my use, it's pretty non intensive, which means I can get away with if I want to use Mac OS, the cheapest laptop Apple makes so this new MacBook Air is the cheapest laptop Apple makes. It is now more expensive than the last one at $ 1200 baseline classic, but this is the one. So this 2018 MacBook Air - it isn't the absolute miles ahead. Game-Changer that blew everyone's mind when the first gen came out, but it's a good laptop still just with a couple small shortcomings so aesthetically, it's still clearly an Apple laptop. It looks just like their others. Full metal, unibody build and great overall build quality and hinge weight and big, generous trackpad. All the things we know Apple does well to USB C ports on one side, headphone jack on the other. The keyboard doesn't have much travel, but it's not the worst Apple keyboard which isn't saying much, but I've already gotten so used to the mushy one on the new MacBook Pro. So this one actually feels fine, it's a little bit more clicky and it's still backlit, which is good and the speakers. Next to the keyboard, with the help of some magnet paper, we can see they're actually much smaller than the grille might make them seem, but they are good speakers, so nothing wrong with that. Apple does laptop speaker as well, but just overall the whole thinness thing is kind of lost like it's not a thick laptop by any means, but I've been using a 13-inch MacBook Pro for a little while now - and this is not noticeably thinner or noticeably lighter than That laptop, if you really want noticeably thin and light, you got to go, get the tiny one port 12-inch MacBook, which is both less powerful and more expensive. So it's kind of a hard sell, fun fact back-to-back on a table. The MacBook Air is thicker at its thickest point. Then the 13-inch MacBook Pro that I've already been using so the wedge shape can make it feel a little thinner. But honestly, it's not really noticeably thin, so don't buy the MacBook Air this year for its thinness. It'S weird to say, but it's true, so beyond the build quality, the display is important to me, and that was the biggest downside of the original MacBook Air, which they still sell by the way, a low resolution with big, thick silver bezels and everything. So that was the biggest upgrade here in the new MacBook Air we asked for it. They made it. So it's now, a 13-inch 2560 by 1440 IPS display thinner, bezels black bezels big time upgrade. The one thing is at max brightness, it's not quite as bright as I want to, or I'm used to from the MacBook Pro or even the surface laptop. They all seem to get brighter. But I find myself using the air at maxed out brightness all the time and that will naturally hit the battery life a bit. It'S a solid b-plus battery life in a laptop still, I'm happy with it, I'm getting the usual seven to eight hours. I normally get, but it's nothing too noteworthy, but overall I just wish the display would get a bit brighter. This FaceTime camera is technically upgraded, although every time I look at one of these built-in webcams in a laptop, I'm always wondering why doesn't anyone put a smartphone quality camera in a laptop? No one. Is it too thin up here at the top of the laptop? I mean you don't need. The oh is just the sensors honestly. This laptop should just have the iPhones front-facing camera and face ID, of course nothing wrong with touch ID here. It'S fine. It works. It'S consistent but wouldn't face ID, be more futuristic like the iPad pro or even like Windows, hello. I really would have loved to have seen face ID here. I want to turn this into some kind of rant, but it's just super not a big risk in any way right. The display it's a big upgrade, but now it's it's fine, the design, it's not very different from any other Apple laptop. It'S fine, the performance. It'S fine, the battery life, it's fine Apple, didn't really take any risks with this one, not that they have to it's actually really smart, not to take any risks. In fact, this is probably the smartest no risk laptop they can make. They had their fan. Favorite and MacBook Air start to pile up requests like hey. Why haven't you updated it with new internals and a Retina display, so they did exactly that they tossed in touch ID and that's about it. This is what you get the question becomes. Is that good enough and I'd say barely I mean it's 1,200 bucks and you can get more laptop for less money if you're willing to move to Windows. We all know this, but a lot of people for many reasons, aren't about to switch to Windows and Apple. Will gladly sell this to those people I would have loved to have seen Apple, make like it eight nine hundred to a thousand dollar laptop, because that new lower price would have been something to get excited about, but as of right now. This isn't that this is the super safe incremental upgrade, which it's weird, that that kind of sounds like a bad thing. It'S not at all. It'S just kind of the curse that Apple gets, because you can't live up to the hype of the incredibly revolutionary first gen MacBook Air. So it's fine and you'll probably enjoy one. If you're, due for a new laptop and this one fits your budget and you want the cheapest Mac OS laptop, this one is good, but this all brings me back to why I love the iPad pro so much. This new iPad pro, which is eight hundred bucks, feels like a real, purposeful, modern redesign because it is, I enjoy using it for more things. The thin bezels are awesome face ID is here and that's great. The performance is incredible and it's an even higher resolution and higher refresh rate 120 Hertz display it's an amazing screen. Those are some real things to get excited about, but when it comes to the iPad pro, there's of course, still just one of those things that I mentioned at the beginning: miscellaneous file, management being a big one that make it impossible for me to replace my laptop With the iPad, even though I want to anyway for me, I'm going to keep my current laptop and my current tablet, I'm gon na keep my 13-inch MacBook Pro, which has been handling everything fine and I'm gon na keep using my iPad pro every chance I get And I've also been trying the surface laptop to a lot more, probably worth a video. Let me know if you guys want to see something on that, but as far as the MacBook Air goes, I'm gon na keep waiting for that big interesting upgrade. Maybe they inevitably switch to those armed ships. Maybe they have much thinner, bezels and face ID. Maybe they actually take those risks? Maybe they do 120 Hertz display something to get excited about, but for now this MacBook Air, it's safe. If it fits the budget, then that'll do either way until the next one. Thanks for watching catch, you guys later peace, """
N1e_voQvHYk,iPad Pro Review: The Best Ever... Still an iPad!,11:14,"So this is the new iPad pro. It is. An incredible tablet still AM iPad, though hey. What is up guys, I'm poppy HD here, and let me just spoil this whole thing for you right off the top. The new ipad pro's hardware is actually incredible, like it's. The most beautiful most powerful, most impressive ipad yet, but thanks to iOS 12, it's just that. It'S just an iPad. It'S not any closer to replacing my laptop use. It'S not any more likely to be my main computer, but it's easily the best iPad ever okay. Let me show you to me, so this iPad pro looks like one of those renders of what people in the past imagined a tablet would look like before the iPad existed is crazy, thin, it's 5.9 millimeters completely flat. It has an incredible nearly bezel, as display somehow has huge, really impressive speakers and super powerful solid-state insides. So right off the bat there's an 11 inch or a 12-point nine inch version and there's a space, grey or silver. I will say the smaller one is much more reasonable and I think it's one most people will get, but I'm a big screen person. So here I am with the crazy big. 12 point, 9 inch iPad pro and I prefer Space Gray. But that's up to you and it's just a marvel to hold like there are pretty sharp edges all the way around, but I love that it's boxy like the iPhone 5s was it stands up on its own and it's so light. The weight distribution is so even throughout the whole slab that you can hold it with a single finger in the middle of the Apple logo. All of this means it's really easy to hold. The edges are kind of sharp, like I said, and they can maybe dig into your hands a bit if you're holding it for a long time with the heavier iPad, but even that is rare battery I thought would suffer from being so thin nope. This tablet has a plus battery life again and the speakers on either side. They have precision milled holes that I just think look really good and yet again the drivers are loud they're far enough apart for stereo effect, they just somehow keep getting better. The camera on the back is the same as the iPhone 10 s and 10 are, and the bump is pretty big because the iPad is so thin, but it's way over in the corner, so my hands never really accidentally touch it or anything, and the tablet is So big and so flat that it actually doesn't really affect the whole lying down flat on a table thing, it still doesn't rock back and forth. I guess if I had to pick something that I don't like about the design, it would be actually the extra and 10 on the cellular version, which I picked they're just not symmetrical. They don't look very even just just a little little off looking little extra. The Wi-Fi version has antenna lines too, but there's not as many but I'm never looking at the back of the iPad anyway. So it doesn't really bother me, oh and no headphone jack. Of course, but you already know how I feel about that - this is Apple, we're talking about here and I'm kind of already on that wireless life anyway, anyway, I have like little little hopes now of a new iPhone next year kind of looking like this, like being Really squared off and boxy, but then pushing the display to the edge yeah. I don't know it probably won't happen if they want to keep wireless charging, of course, but I still would love that so clearly, I like the outside the aesthetics. The feel, in the hand, is awesome hardware and on the inside it gets even more impressive. First of all, there's no finger Parader, no home button, since the bezels are so thin, but there is the whole suite of face ID sensors in the iPad pro and they work now in any orientation. So you can be portrait landscape upside down, no matter what it works, which is helpful, because the fact that the front of the iPad is so uniform makes it easy to forget, which way is the top? Sometimes you grab it and you try to unlock it in your hand, is covering the sensor since the bezels so thin, but it just points a little arrow and tells you you're covering the sensor. So you can unblock it and then you're in and the display is again easily, not just one of the best in any tablet, but one of the best screens I've ever used. It'S the 120 Hertz IPS LCD super accurate, colors, great viewing angles, ultra responsive and smooth and very bright when you need it true tone there. Also, if you want it and the anti-reflective coating is great so face ID is good. The display is about as good as it gets and then the specs now you've probably heard me say before about Apple products. The numbers don't really matter as much and that's still true here, but let me give you this a 12 X. Bionic is absolutely incredible. It is the fastest chip I've ever seen in a mobile device if you've seen Geekbench scores, that's been pretty popular lately as benchmarking faster than many laptops rivaling the 15-inch MacBook Pro it has four gigs of RAM and for some reason the one terabyte iPad has six Gigs of RAM, but generally performance is just really good from multitasking the flying through apps productivity photo-editing. It'S all fast and fluid. It'S a plus performance, just like the previous iPad pro. But now you have Headroom for days like it's more about being future-proof and you're. Very future proof here and then even the accessory ecosystem is all upgraded. The new Apple pencil way better. Obviously you can't get much more awkward than this. Was it's not a high bar to clear, but it is now great it snaps on to the side of the iPad with magnets and pears and wirelessly charges. There there's a little cutout on the side of this all-metal iPad that lets the wireless charging work through here and it lines everything up. I just think I missed out on an opportunity to call the second-generation Apple pencil a number two pencil. Maybe maybe that's just me anyway. There'S also now a new thinner, folio case and a new keyboard case as well. These aren't things I use very much. I do sometimes have the folio on and they now connect via magnets throughout the whole back of the iPad and they line up really quickly and snap into place which makes them easy to put on and take off, but sturdy while it is connected. So here's the fun visual I show this on Twitter. This is what you could call magnet paper, something like that. It has filaments inside that respond to a magnetic charge and when you pass it over something like the iPad, it can show you where inside the magnets are, so you put it down on the iPad, and you can see that there are magnets a lot of them Everywhere all around the perimeter and they match up with the same magnet in Apple's accessories and that's what helps them lock into place so quickly and easily that pins always line up. It'S smart and I'll leave a link below. If you want to get some of this magic paper to look and see where magnets are at other things, the most Apple and 2018 thing ever, though, is all the price hikes. So every single thing we just talked about the new pencil, the new folio case, the keyboard case and a tablet itself are all more expensive than last year's versions which again you can't ignore that. But you could also argue these all works so well together, better than any third-party version that that's why people, including myself, keep buying these. So what's the holdup iOS 12 and it's weird to say, because iOS 12 is great, it's the best version of iOS. Yet by a lot and it's my favorite, but on this hardware it leaves a lot to be desired. Like don't get me wrong, it's an incredible iPad, but every year, when you know the new iPad pro comes out, we revisit this conversation of chemists, replace my laptop. Can it be my primary computer? You know it's it's a better performer! Now, it's benchmarking higher than my old laptop. It'S got more storage than a laptop. It has a better display. It'S a touchscreen, it's 120 Hertz, it's more expensive. Surely this can replace my laptop right? Well, I wish I could replace my computer with an iPad pro because I enjoy using the iPad that much more, but there are still things that I need to do on a pretty regular basis that the iPad doesn't that I need to keep a laptop around for The big ones no file ecosystem, so if I'm photo editing - and I want to bring other files in it's kind of incredibly annoying like this thing needs finder, not the current files, app, I'm a youtuber. I want to be able to go to the YouTube for desktop site and then go into the YouTube studio and go through analytics and studio features that way mobile safari will not. Let me it kicks me out into the YouTube app every single time. Staying with Google Drive there is a Google Drive app, but I want the desktop app with all the desktop features and the desktop UI, and I can't do that in the default browser. There'S no trackpad or Mouse support in iOS at all, so the keyboard works great. If you have one, but you can plug in any Mouse in the world and it won't do anything and then the USB C port you'd think would unlock a world of possibilities of connecting all kinds of accessories and being able to talk to them through the iPad. First of all, Thunderbolt accessories don't work at all like they would on a laptop. Only USB type-c does so you can plug in a display, for example, but this is something you could already do with lightning, and still all it will do is mirror the display. But now it's up to 5k, so the closest I can get to my ideal scenario, at least with creative stuff on the iPad pro is photo editing. Actually, so my camera of choice is a Hasselblad x1d. It has a USB type-c port, so when I plug it in to the iPad pro, nothing happens it actually, it just starts charging the camera. So while that's a letdown, I basically will have to take the SD card out and I have a USB see two SD card adapter. I plug that in then I get to import the file. It goes into photos. I can bring that into Lightroom, and then I can do all my edits with the raw file and editing on the iPad. Pro is easily my favorite way of editing photos with the pencil with the awesome hundred twenty display. It'S great, but that's exactly what I could do with the Lightning port before, in fact, there's virtually nothing really new that I can do with the USBC port on the iPad pro that I couldn't already do with a lightning adapter. All I'm doing is getting rid of the dongles, and I love that I don't need a $ 40.00 Lightning dongle anymore, but thanks to iOS it doesn't mean as much now as I think it could in the future. So basically, this iPad pro the hardware like I've, said it's crazy. It'S great! It'S better than a lot of laptops, it's better than Apple's, cheapest laptops actually, but it's definitely still an iPad. It does all the same things that the previous iPad pro did just better, and that is like a textbook like great thing to say about a product. It'S it's all better than what it did last year. But like this conversation of or at least what Apple tries to do, of comparing it to laptops over and over again puts it in a weird space and I've seen people who's who's. Creative workflows happen to fit this iPad pro into the puzzle of what they do. Perfectly I'm so jealous of those people, there's people who will sketch for hours on the iPad pro who are DJs on the iPad Pro who are doing video editing on the iPad Pro and if it does meet your needs for that, then this is an incredible. An incredible iPad, this all has me thinking about two things: one maybe iOS 13, when that comes out, will really turn the iPad into it's. Its true form, its final form, it'll unlock the USB C port. To do way more things, it'll have better file management. It'Ll. Do all these things to get it closer to a main computer, maybe and to when is Apple gon na start, putting their incredibly powerful chips in Macs like in the new MacBook Air, which is running and slightly underpowered Intel chip? Maybe that's coming in the future. Sometime soon, maybe, but until then, this is just the greatest iPad. Ever thanks for watching talk to you, the next one, peace """
xsiV_-o5488,iPhone XR Review: No Need to Panic!,10:25,"What'S up guys mkbhd, here 755 product launches later, we've made it through tech, tober took a little breath and now we're right back at it with november, and it just keeps going, and i've started my november with this. This is the iphone 10r and this one already has a bit of a reputation, but ideally with my testing and hopefully in this review, we can look past that little reputation and figure out what this phone really is. I mean it's another iphone and i already reviewed the iphone the 10s so i'll leave that link to the review below. But this one is very similar in a lot of ways with the new parts in the new design, but with some key differences. So for this video, let's look at everything, that's different about the iphone 10r that adds up to 250 cheaper and what i think of it. Okay, so first things, first is the size. The iphone 10r sits right in between the 10s and the 10s max. With this 6.1 inch display it's fine, i'm one of those people who wishes there was an even smaller iphone, so the difference was more apparent, but this 6.1 inch display kind of splits, the middle. It'S definitely harder for most people to reach the corners and the tops of this display, because it is so big. That'S one of those things, though, that you can check out just by getting in a store and seeing for yourself, but this size for me is fine and then the build. The iphone 10r is made from different materials, and it's built differently than the 10s. Even with pretty much the same looking design, there's no stainless steel here, iphone 10r has anodized aluminum sides, which means they can color match them to get it to match the glass backs. And yes, there are the six new colors and i know i've said before the red is my favorite and yes, it still is, but i'm gon na go ahead and give my second place to this blue. I really like it. I think it's quite nice. The coral on the yellow - don't really speak to me as much, i think, mostly because of the rail colors being a little less saturated and the black and the white are just black and white, so the red and the blue are definitely my two favorite 10r colors. Also small difference: the iphone 10rs water resistance is ip67, where the iphone 10s was ip68 so worth noting and you'll also notice the slightly different locations for the antenna bands. The 10r is missing a couple just a pair of visible bands that are on the 10s and the 10r since it lacks these bands does not have gigabit lte. This only affects a tiny number of people who are actually in an area where their carrier supports gigabit lte, but hey it's different. So there you have it overall, i'm mostly a fan of the build of the 10r. I think the colors are awesome. They didn't have to do colors, so i'm glad they did. The backs with the glass are super saturated and bright and vibrant, but the aluminum on all the colors on the rails is always less saturated than the glass which makes sense, but it's kind of a bummer. If you put a case or skin on it, because then you hide the awesome color of the glass and you just get the metal. It'S not the end of the world, but just had to point that out also with the aluminum, it's even more slippery than the stainless steel. This is, i think, the new slipperiest phone in the world champ prone to sliding out of your pockets, if you're, not careful. So be careful, okay, so the display this is the biggest difference versus the iphone 10s. This is why apple was able to make this phone that cost 250 dollars less. This is why this phone even has a reputation already before people even get to use it. This is the most controversial part of this phone. Iphone 10r has what apple calls a liquid retina display? You can ignore the fancy name, but it's an lcd with curved corners, it's 1792 by 828, and it's surrounded by this slightly thicker bezel the panel itself. It has great color and brightness pretty good viewing angles and believe it or not. It'S actually crisp enough for me at regular use, though i do start to see it as less sharp than the 10s when i pixel peep from close up, but it's really not a bad display by any means. It'S accurate, it's vibrant! It feels like the easiest way to make the iphone 10rs display seem bad is to focus entirely on the numbers of it. Don'T even look at the display just look at the spec sheet and the numbers on paper, it's less than 1080p and it's 326 pixels per inch. That'S the pixel density. You know what else has that pixel density, the iphone 4.? That'S an easy way to make. It look bad, but you know it also has a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch, the iphone 8., and that was fine. Most people didn't complain about that, and that was a great display so really focusing on the numbers. Isn'T the most productive thing? Just look at well the actual experience of using this phone and looking at the display and in practice the biggest losses for me with the 10r display are no 3d touch and no oled apple did bring touch to wake to the 10r. So you don't lose that, but obviously contrast in the black when you're watching a video isn't quite the same with an lcd, and even though this is one of the best lcds you're not going to have the pitch black 7 oled. I personally didn't use 3d touch that much anyway, pretty much only in the control center and the lock screen. So on the 10r. You can do almost the same thing with a long press that will work in the control center and on the lock screen shortcuts. But you can't peek and pop into links and previews and things like that. That'S almost completely gone from the 10r, but i honestly don't miss it that much. You still have true tone. So if you're into that, i don't really use true tone. But if you do it's also here and you have tap to wake like i said you have rounded corners, it's fine! The display, no need to panic. It'S really fine. As a matter of fact what i really noticed, the most isn't the resolution. It isn't. The lack of 3d touch, it's the bezels, these bezels all the way around here. Just a couple millimeters thicker than the iphone 10s are noticeable to me every day and to be fair after a little while you do get used to it, but as a person that has used an iphone 10s. I much prefer that it looks and feels that much more modern to shave - i guess one or two millimeters, all the way around the bezel, so sure it's a bummer that you can't watch full 1080p videos, especially on this larger display. Trust me, 1440 does look a lot better. I would know, and it's a downgrade to lcd and there's no 3d touch, but the bezels to me are actually the most consistently noticeable difference that you'll have and you'll have to be okay with them. If you're going to rock this phone, all right, two quick ones, the ram and the battery both of these are kind of a side effect of them going with the lower resolution display. First of all, there is one gig less of ram, so three gigs of ram. Instead of four but honestly, that's kind of all you need in ios when you're pushing way less pixels and ram management is already great and then the battery the iphone 10r has a 2942 milliamp hour battery, and it's really good now for most phones. That statement wouldn't really line up, but again, because that a12 bionic is so powerful and it's pushing way less pixels the iphone 10rs battery life is excellent, just as good as the 10s max, and sometimes better it's one of the best parts of this phone. Of course, i would expect a phone this big to have all-day battery life just out of principle, but having it be better than i expected was a pleasant surprise, so that leaves the biggest difference. The camera, the single camera on the back of the iphone 10r, which is the exact same as the primary camera on the 10s minus the second telephoto. Some people have noticed uh slightly different image quality from the 10rs camera versus the 10s. I have not for me. It'S still the same, a very good iphone camera, but subtracting that telephoto lens has actually had some interesting implications that aren't all negative so that telephoto camera, as you know, is good for two things: optical zoom and portrait mode. So optical zoom, yeah, that's gone. You concede a worse quality digital zoom, but here's a little not so secret secret about zoom on the iphone that telephoto lens has always been a worst quality sensor and image that just let in less light so oftentimes. In worse conditions, specifically low light. The iphone will realize that the optical zoom, coming from the darker lens, is actually not as good as the primary, so it'll just take the digital zoom from the primary lens anyway. So yeah there is no telephoto lens on the iphone 10r, but i think that affects a lot less zoom scenarios than we actually realize and oftentimes we're going to get better results from using the better camera. And then the other thing is portrait mode. So the 10s would use both cameras for depth detection and then use a telephoto camera to zoom in for a better natural bokeh. The 10r portrait mode obviously doesn't do this, which means it's always using the better quality primary camera. And it's a wider angle, and i don't know if you've noticed but uh wider angle, portraits with a shallow depth of field, is kind of my favorite look, it's kind of a thing. I think it's the most visually interesting version of a portrait, so i kind of really like this they've remapped the background blur to look more like a wide angle optic than telephoto, and it makes a real difference through all the bokeh adjustment. I really do notice it. The background feels kind of more swirly, sometimes like they have more character, but there is of course, a downside, which is that it doesn't have depth detection anymore at all. So it's doing pretty much all of the work with software and with that apple has limited it to photos of human faces. Only so if you try to take a portrait mode of anything else, it won't work. It'Ll tell you it's kind of waiting for a person to be detected, so that's kind of a bummer, no portrait shots of objects, which i started doing more on plenty of other android phones, but that's the price you pay in apple's world. So all those previous points have added up to the iphone 10r starting at 750 bucks for 64 gigs. Definitely not a budget phone, don't let anyone tell you it's a budget phone, but at 250.00 cheaper than the iphone 10s. This is a much better deal. The biggest downsides are the display and the camera. I know a lot of things i kind of spoke about in the camera were pretty positive, but don't let me fool you into thinking: it's a better camera. Those are the biggest downsides of this phone, but those are when comparing it to the iphone 10s, but a lot of people are coming from iphone 8 and iphone 7 and older, and for those people this is an upgrade in pretty much every possible way and for Not much more money, the iphone 8 started for 700 bucks. This is 750., so my conclusion is pretty much the same as i suspected when this phone first got announced, which is this, is the best seller iphone for everyone. They didn't even have to do. Colors. Imagine if they just did a black and white iphone 10r, a little more boring, probably would have flown more under the radar. But the fact that they did the colors is kind of like a cherry on top. So if you're one of those people who was already going to get an iphone 10s or 10s max, you probably still should just like, i said in the review - it's not like you should switch to this instead of that, but if you're on one of those older Phones, iphone 10r is a good upgrade. I recommend it there's nothing to panic about nothing crazy wrong with it thumbs up for me on this phone. That'S been it thanks for watching talk to you in the next one peace """
bNLgikGu4Yw,RED Hydrogen One Review: I Wanted this to be Great!,17:09,"[ Laughter ], what's up guys mkbhd here, and this is the red hydrogen one and it's. This is a really weird phone and a lot of ways there have been so many questions about this thing is a really a $ 1,295 device. I new red cameras are expensive, but why is the phone so expensive? What'S so good about it? Is it like a red camera in your pocket? Who is it for what makes it special? What is a holographic media machine, and why does this exist? You got questions. I got answers and I've actually been in the unique position of not only using the phone for the past couple months, but actually seeing and following along with the development of it behind the scenes for almost as long you guys might remember the video I did on The early prototype of the hydrogen back and it was still somewhat of an idea I was into it. I shared it red - wanted to share with you what they were working on with the world, but since then a lot has changed and it's all landed on this. The final retail shipping version of the red hydrogen one and as it exists, it is the most frustrating phone that I've bought this year. So as a smartphone, this thing is pretty scattered. It definitely doesn't resemble any other phone in pretty much any way on the outside. Like it clearly doesn't fit in with the 2018 glass sandwich design and notches and actually think it's perfectly fine being different, I would describe this as more of a modern industrial. Look, it's a huge phone. First of all, it has only a 5.7 inch display which we'll talk a lot more about in a bit, but it's not the biggest screen out there, but it has the huge bezels around it. There'S a giant forehead and a chin with big speakers in them and we'll also talk a lot about those and a pretty serious looking array of front-facing cameras and sensors and an LED notification light. And then the back. Is this two-tone look with exposed carbon fiber and aluminum, and just open seams and ridges and textures, and there's also a lot of text all around this phone? So it looks and feels industrial and then you have this whole rubberized side grip, which, with my hands, is fine. The way I hold the phone but yeah, it's basically the opposite of an iPhone. As far as build and slipperiness goes matter of fact, here's my little anti plug, don't put Adi brand skin on it, don't put a case on it. It feels like it already has a case on it. It'S built like an absolute tank. It turns out. That'S a big reason why this phone cost $ 1,300, these materials, the carbon fiber and metal, but beyond that there's pretty much. No other reason why someone would spend that much on this phone. Let'S get into all the other things. It'S a big phone like I said, and it makes a pretty good use of that space, keeping a headphone jack up at the top, the microSD card slot USB see at the bottom and it's packed in a 4500 milliamp hour battery, so the biggest in any phone. I'Ve tested so far no IP rating, yet though, but they say they're working on it, probably because of those exposed pins on the back I'll tweet or share an update if they do get approved for IB, 68 or 67, or something like that. But then on the inside since this phone's been in development for a year now, it's using specs from a year ago, so Snapdragon 835, six gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage and expandable and that huge battery. So yes, you did hear that right. I said Snapdragon 835, not Snapdragon a 45, and to be honest, if you just handed me a phone and asked me if I could tell if it was the eight five or 8:45 I probably wouldn't, but when you're spending $ 1,295 minimum for this phone, you kind Of expect the latest and greatest highest end hardware, and that's not what you're getting here but to be real. The performance is actually fine, as it should be because there's pretty much no skin or any sort of heavy customization happening here. I'Ve always said staying near stock Android is great for both performance and hopefully quick updates. So I can confirm on performance, but there's no word on Android P for this phone, but I've gotten, maybe seven or eight software updates. Since I started testing pretty much, all of them have been camera related though, but yeah. Basically, the only customization we'll find in the hydrogen software is this red launcher, which is actually pretty good. It feels like Nova Launcher and has a lot of options and then some ugly custom icons and some pre-installed apps for holographic content, but yeah. That'S why the performance and battery life are actually good. The software is simple enough and you've got six years of RAM. Okay, so this is the part where we should address the frustrating part of this phone. What is a holographic media machine? Why is that the tagline for this phone? Well, it's because of three things: the display the speakers and the cameras on this phone they're all specialized for something called four views. So, let's start with the display. It'S a 5.7 inch panel, like I said, LCD 2560 by 1440, so pretty high pixel density and through normal use in 2d mode normal mode. It seems pretty good. Colors and contrasts are on point at first glance. The viewing angles are good, but I'll get back to that in a second. What'S unique, is this special mode, a glasses list 3d that works in portrait or landscape with specially formatted content for view content, holographic content? So don't let the word holographic fool! You! That'S just like one of their marketing terms: it's not like there's stuff like floating out over the display like a hologram and then in a no it's. It'S still a very much. What you'd expect out of a glasses list. 3D experience it's all on the display, but it's more about depth and it's sometimes pretty good now, obviously, cameras don't show it pretty much at all. So sadly, I can't give you this experience. This is kind of the best I can do, but my best attempt at describing what you should be seeing is it's like this sort of shimmery trippy 3d depth effect that you can see when you look at it head-on. I actually think when it's used well and content is shot for for view. It'S actually pretty good. I'Ve showed this to a couple. People and their reactions have been more or less impressed when there's content, specifically, like I said made for this format, things will sort of pop out of the screen and appear to fly at you like a 3d movie. It'S a good 3d effect. It'S fun. Some content. Doesn'T look good, though, especially when it's more flat or there's less separation between a foreground and a background, or if it's just poorly converted, it just looks like a sort of a lame pixelated version of normal footage. So it's hit or miss in this way, but, like any 3d effect also, you don't really want to look at it. For too long I fatigue is real. Hologram me.how holographic is the word they use, but it's it's hard to explain and it's kind of trippy whoa dude. This is weird and there's there's different like so there's a movie trailer version of it. Where there's like things coming towards you - and I think, that's maybe the best use of it - I've seen it's impossible to show on camera. I'Ve tried many different times. No. This will never show up on camera. This yeah. This is odd, yeah, okay, so it has this cool mode, but now, as a result, you also have some other downsides of the display. A couple. Actually, the fact that it works in portrait or landscape is pretty cool. Most 3d effects only work with the display. One orientation, but because of the hardware layer that makes this possible, the brightness specifically suffers quite a bit, so the hydrogen-1 screen just does not get very bright and then in 2d or regular mode, you'll notice. It looks I would describe it as kind of pixelated and I don't even have to pixel peep very hard to notice it, especially on white backgrounds. That, again, is because of that hardware layer. This display tech, so the 513 pixels per inch kind of doesn't mean that much if I'm constantly seeing what looks like these dots on the screen, all the time look at this side-by-side with the pixel 3 display. That'S a big difference now. The interesting news here is, I asked Jim from read about this and he says that it's a combination of part hardware, part software and that it can technically be improved with software updates and that it used to be worse and that it's gotten better to the point That it exists now. I want to believe I want to believe that it can keep getting better to the point where it's almost totally gone, but I don't know, but what I'm gon na do is actually I'll post the entire little mini interview. I did with Jim founder of red and you can hear exactly what he has to say for it, his very PR answers or whatever, but I'll link it right below the like button. If you're interested in hearing that but yeah it's it's just I I can trust my eye about what I observe and then you can listen to what he says. So that's the display and then you have these speakers flanking it. They are also optimized for for view. Now, in a big phone like this, like maybe a razor phone or a pixel, three, I'm bracing myself for amazing speakers right like they, they have these these huge spaces for big drivers, they're not going to be easy to block. I'M ready to be really happy with these speakers. Pull up some audio anything music games, video whatever and the speaker on the hydrogen one isn't even louder than average [ Applause ]. This speaker doesn't sound that great. I put the volume all the way up to max and to be fair, it doesn't distort much so that's an upside, but it's also really lacking and a little bit tinny kind of sounds like a big, weak laptop speaker in the first place. It'S a pretty big letdown to me. There is one setting you can tweak, though, and it's called 3d audio and when you toggle it on it gets even worse now. The 3d effect it creates is actually noticeable. So then, you start to hear the left and right stereo separation. The sort of pseudo surround sound effect that you'd be similar to hearing on an iPhone, but it's not that good and it's even more tinny now and still not very loud and then on the back. There are those cameras. This was one of the original reasons I was so excited. When I heard red was making a smart phone like the space was getting interesting. We had the pixel that was kind of the king of cameras for a while that iPhone 10's step. Their game up and then pixel three sort of expanded their lead. We have all these other cameras with these multiple lenses and multiple cameras on the front and the back, and then we heard red a specialty camera maker that I obviously love was gon na step in and make a smart phone which would have cameras on it. This should be amazing, I'm ready for this and well it turns out. These cameras are just they're: okay, they're, just okay, it is dual 12 megapixel cameras in the hump of the back dual LED flash and the cameras are spaced out far enough. Apart for death, detection and I've been sharing actually photos from hydrogen camera here and there for the better part of a couple months now among multiple software updates and are rapidly evolving color science and camera app. But here's the thing to understand red doesn't make this camera. This is a like an off-the-shelf camera, probably a Sony IMX sensor or something like that. The same kind you see in a bunch of other smartphones, so the best that red can do is what they can get out of this sensor and their improvements in color, science and HDR and software. But Red's cameras like the one I'm using for this video are so incredible because red is so good and making the silicon the actual sensor, that's used to shoot, and then they control the entire image processing pipeline and they make the camera and the software and everything. So they control the entire end-to-end, but here with the hydrogen, like I said they don't make these sensors they're just doing the best they can with off-the-shelf parts and software. So if you were expecting some sort of extreme read quality camera built into the smartphone, that's not what you're getting here hold that thought until the end, so yeah photos from the hydrogen's built-in camera are all right. There, they're solid with color and dynamic range. I left HDR turned on the whole time. Often Reds became a little bit muddy. Sharpness was pretty much always good, but photos in general we're just hit or miss. Basically, you have to give it a lot of light and it'll do fine, but things start to fall apart in less than ideal conditions. This isn't drastically better or worse than something I'd expect out of like a 1 plus 60, and obviously software updates will continue to make tweaks and adjustments over time, but that's just where we're at now. Of course, red is mostly known for their video cameras. So, how good is the 4k video here again with the built-in stuff, pretty good, but nothing, exceptional or unbelievable, again, think 1, 6 level or even LGV 40 level on a good day, nothing to write home about at this point, so the camera can also, as you Imagine capture more for view content both on the back with the dual cameras or even a for view. Selfie with the front-facing array. So really read cares a lot about this for view, maybe to a fault. There is a whole solid inventory of content shot for for view some trailers and some cinematic footage and stuff, like that. It'S great for demos and that's what I've been showing people and there's also an entire app store filled with apps and games that support the holographic display mode. But if I'm looking at this right, it looks like there's only about 20 apps in the whole store and while that probably is necessary for delivering for view content with the special mode hydrogen buyers, I guess you can't do through the Play Store. I guess it's fine. It just it just looks weird that you need a whole separate, app store and a whole separate content store just for supporting for view like YouTube, doesn't support for view, for example, and as far as photos no other phone out there can view for view photos either, But to see what other people with hydrogens are: shooting there's this app that actually like called hollow pix, it's kind of like an Instagram, but just for the 3d for view photos there's a lot of cool stuff on here that people are shooting, but there's basically just A couple hundred users at this point just people with hydrogen's. I have four followers on here, so I check me out, but also I've gone down through the list. Now you've probably noticed there aren't really a whole lot of overwhelmingly positive things to say about this $ 1,295 phone as it exists right now, the one and only upside that I could possibly think of to save this phone and actually what makes it so frustrating is Red what I didn't talk about her mentioned even at all in this video is the pins down here at the bottom of the back of the phone. These exposed, pin arrays, similar to what we've seen on like moto phones as they've experimented with modularity, are a sort of an unlockable key that hasn't been turned yet at the bottom of red site. They have a whole section about modules: expandable storage, camera module and power pack modules all coming in 2019. So you can see you know: a power pack module for extra battery life on the already huge battery or an expandable storage module for adding even more storage. Again, pretty simple or the camera module the cinema module, which would be adding a custom read made sensor and an interchangeable lens mount which would turn this via that. That'S what we want that would make this the red camera in your pocket that we were originally excited about. From top to bottom, read silicon interchangeable lens mount smartphone form factor that would totally level up this device, but as of right now, that's just a complete fantasy that just exists in the text on that page. For now, I even asked Jim about this as well, and he just confirmed what it already says on the site, which is just 2019 sometime in 2019. I think I think, there's really basically just two ways to think about this phone. Depending on how you feel about red. This one is either an overpriced total flop with last year's specs and some gimmicky 3d, or this is some revolutionary upcoming modular device somewhere between a smartphone and a portable cinema camera with this virtual reality moe it all wrapped. In one thing, you probably already know which side to stand on as of right now, there's honestly no way to recommend this phone for $ 1,300, like imagine this phone without red attached to it at all, without the red label or the red name on it. This is at that point, just some hopeless, like random, Android phone, probably a $ 400 device with no hope of ever getting modules, but with red behind it. If you trust red, if you respect red - and you think they're gon na stay behind this, then this could be a really interesting device in the next year. The only redeeming quality is the potential for future improvement. If you trust red - and I wanted this phone to be so good and parts of it - are pretty good but as a complete package there's only a tiny sliver of people, I could say should actually buy it as is, and even those people should probably wait and Save your money so I'll be waiting for the modules or hydrogen. Whichever comes first either way. That'S been it thanks for watching talk to guys the next one base. """
_6-XjSvbJsE,"OnePlus 6T Review: New Design, Same Price!",8:30,"Hey, what's up guys, i'm pbht here and well welcome back to tech Tober the event that we were waiting for it just wrapped up, which means I'm now allowed to share that my daily driver for the past couple days has been the brand-new 1 plus 60. So this one's had a lot of hype leading up to it. We started seeing those specs and a little bit of design leaks, and basically it got a lot of people waiting for this phone, so the 1 plus 60 is in the purest sense of the word. An incremental update, most of it, is the same as a 1 plus 6 that we're already familiar with that. I liked a lot and then you could consider this a bit of a design refresh a couple months later, so they took the one plus 6, which is already pretty solid and well-liked phone and then made some upgrades and some tweaks to things that they felt could Be better and they took it up a notch: ok, there's your knotch pun for the video, so there are conveniently 6 new things with the oneplus 60. So, first of all the new display, it's bigger. It'S a six point. Four inch display and still you're 23 40 by 1080 optic, AMOLED they've been on for a while, and it's still pretty great, it's bright its colorful and has a built-in adjustable color profiles. Obviously, I'm a big phone person and phone screens keep getting bigger and I still love it also slightly smaller chin than the 1 plus 6 not drastically smaller, but you can see it when you put them side-by-side, so the display is definitely an improvement, and that brings Us to number two, as you can see the teardrop notch up here at the top everything oneplus wanted to do with the fairly standard notch on the oneplus 6. They are still doing in a smaller notch on this 60, except for the notification LED. So up here is the front-facing camera, the earpiece and the proximity and ambient light sensors. No fancy face ID dot, projector or depth sensors, or anything like that, but just a pretty solid basic couple things they can still do. They'Re super fast facial recognition with the RGB camera that has its pros and cons, and the speaker is slotted way up here at the top, but it wasn't doing a whole lot anyway. So we're not missing out much by shoving a tiny speaker up there and for a lot of people, including me. This is an improvement, larger screen closer to the bezels and more room up top for notifications and info, but you can still hide the notch with software. If you want to the only weird feeling I got about it is like how pervy it is just I mean that's quite the curve from left to right, if you remember the essential phone that notch had probably about the same volume in total size, but it was Pretty rectangular on the sides, this one is all slope II and then it just it just touches the top of whatever app you're using in the middle. It'S interesting, but you get used to it, just like any other notch. Okay, number three is the fingerprint reader underneath the display something again. A lot of people were looking forward to happy to see this slowly starting to become more common in mainstream phones, so that one plus six couple months ago had the fingerprint reader on the back. That'S now gone and it's moved the logo up a little bit in its place, and you can now unlock your phone by just touching the glass I've left. It enabled the entire time I've been using it and I'd say it's it's faster than that. First gen from the vivo phone I first tested a couple months ago, but still slower than the gold standard of like touch ID or a lot of the physical fingerprint readers. It'S just somewhere in between it's, not instant, but it's just a little beat of you, unlocking your phone. It'S it's getting there. You can't really just touch your finger to the screen and then remove it quickly and get to using the phone. It'Ll still tell you you're going too fast, but if you leave it there for a beat you're in pretty quick, the animation is pretty corny. I think and there's two others you can pick from in the software. But the thing is they all happen at full brightness. That'S part of how the tech of this optical fingerprint reader, underneath the screen works, involves shining a light on your fingerprint. So even though it's an OLED and they can keep all the pixels black and the clock is dimmed to save battery the fingerprint reader. When it reads your finger goes to max brightness and at night that can be kind of annoying. Basically, I was hoping there could be an even more subtle animation than the three that were provided. Also, that means that unlocking the phone at night or when it's dark specifically is kind of annoying. I know it's definitely nitpicking at this point but think about it. I have both face, unlock and fingerprint unlock and able at night when it's dark, the face unlock camera which just uses the RGB camera doesn't work very well. So you have to use the fingerprint and then, when you use the fingerprint, it shines that full brightness light that kind of bleeds around your finger into your face, which is kind of annoying just I know again super minor, but this is the kind of stuff you Notice when you use a phone every day, so I'll mention it number four is the new battery. So while the phone is pretty much the same size, this is one pluses biggest improvement on paper going from a 3300 to a 3700 milliamp hour battery. That has been awesome in practice for the endurance of this phone. The six was already pretty good, but I'm now getting pretty consistently 5 plus hours of screen on time. One of the days I had nearly 6 hours with 10 % left, so it might not be a four thousand milliamp hours so like it isn't the biggest number on paper. But this improvement thanks to the 1080p OLED and pretty clean software. Has this basically my battery champ this year so far, and it still has that incredibly fast, fast charging, so that is impressive, then number five, it's true! The headphone jack is now gone on. The 60 even oneplus, is getting rid of the headphone jack a moment of silence for its loss. So, yes, 2018, pretty much. Only Samsung and LG are left still riding that headphone jack train and it's kind of interesting coming from a company like oneplus who we know to usually be first to listen to what users want. So when I ask them what their reasoning was for not having a headphone jack, because I got to ask them directly, they said it's the larger battery and the finger per meter under the screen both take up so much extra space in this same sized phone that They felt it made sense to get rid of the headphone jack, so that's their words and a number six new different thing is probably the best news. This phone starts at 128, gigs of storage now, instead of 64 and for the same exact price as the last one 549. So you get twice as much storage for the same starting price and this whole new design, so one plus is sure sticking to their guns of competitive pricing and then that's it. Everything else about the oneplus 60 and the software on the surface. Under the hood materials and build it's all the same as that one plus 6 same oxygen, OS on top of Android Pi, with the new gestures and all the new features. Oneplus has been throwing in same smoothness and a plus performance that I was so happy about. A couple months ago that drew me away from the pixel same snapdragon, 845 and 6 or 8 gigs of ram. So I expected to continue to be smooth same colors, so it's launching with this midnight black or a mirror black, which means you may still want to toss on a skin from our sponsor D brand, this matrix black. They have happens to look pretty damn good, and now you won't see nearly as many fingerprints, so kind of a win-win there, and one plus still took the shortcuts they took last year. So no wireless charging, for example. Even though it's a glass back phone and it's the same exact camera, the hardware sensor and lens and everything as the one plus six, so you can see photos from last year's phone. They are going to start to look better with each round of software updates. They'Re learning a lot from pixel and iPhones HDR techniques and building them in here plus a new night mode is here that does more with longer exposures and dark scenes. But of course, all these changes are also coming to the exact same one plus six camera. Since it's just a software change and they kept, of course, one of the most important things about the six, which was a starting price, easy recommendation - this is a great phone now, it's also coming with Verizon compatibility and they're gon na start working with t-mobile you'll see It in t-mobile stores, I'm assuming so this is gon na - be making its first big push in two carriers in the US, which is pretty cool yeah. There'S a lot going for this phone. It'S continued to impress me, even though they got rid of the headphone jack, which is a bummer for a lot of people, but it's been impressive. How much they stick with the fast and smooth mantra through their phones. These have been consistently the fastest phones. I use for the past couple years, which is great, that's a function of how much they care about software, so I have no problem recommending one plus 60. This is just the one plus six in a prettier higher tech package with a bigger battery for the same price. Can'T really go wrong there. So that's been it. What do you think? Is this your next phone? Let me know, thanks for watching talk to you guys in the next one face. """
E67Klqw2H-E,Google Pixel 3 XL Review: The Shadow of the Notch!,15:18,"Hey whip up guy ISM could be HD here and welcome to the full review of the Google pixel 3 XL, and also welcome to the first wider widescreen video I've done. So let me know if you guys think of that. So this is the phone I'll be using for the past week and change and obviously it's been leaked into oblivion. So I kind of knew what I was getting myself into, but there's still so much smart stuff to talk about. This is maybe the smartest smartphone I've ever used with some caveat, so this video is gon na be mainly centered around pixel three XL, but everything, I will say also applies to the pixel 3 unless I say otherwise. Here we go so on the outside. I really like the new hard work. This felt it's pretty much better in every way than the pixel 2 from the way it feels to the way it's built. The highlights of the pixel 2 are still here, so the stereo front facing speaker pair still here, the squeeze 4 assistant, the two-tone back, look, but now there are new materials and just a new quality to it. We all know the back is now all glass, but this two-tone look comes from frosting, the glass of the lower part, and it's impressive that it actually gives you this soft touch feel. But, as you can see, it's not perfect, it can be very easily scratched. You might remember, I didn't unboxing of this phone on Instagram live and within seconds of taking it out the box without even ever putting it in my pocket once there were these little little tiny scratches in the back on the soft touch part. So it turns out those tiny little scratches the micro scratches they can buff out pretty easily with your shirt or a microfiber or something they're, definitely still there, but they're just really hard to see. But this major gash here this came while actually shooting this video during the intro shot to hold it still. It was like sandwiched between two batteries so like not a normal place to be, but then we took it out and it had this pretty much unfixable gash. I really don't think most phones would scratch this bad from that amount of contact. So obviously that's the downside of the soft touch glass. Now, if you want to protect it, you already know I'm more of a skins person than a case person and the D brand skin can match the matte black. If you want or make the phone whatever color, you want, it's a no brainer and, of course, wireless charging still works through a case or a skin. So there's a link below anyway. With this new build, you get ip68 water resistance that the pixel didn't have and, like I said, wireless charging is welcome, and this is the part where I give a shout out actually to my favorite wireless charger. Now the new pixel stand is 80 bucks, and it's it's everything. I want a wireless charger to be it's great anyway. The buttons of the phone are clicky and tactile and good. The fingerprint reader is exactly where it should be. If it's not going to be behind the glass yet and they've even got little touches like painting the inside of the USBC port, black there's still no headphone jack, but it comes with USB C headphones in the box, which is a lot better than the opposite. That Apple is doing of taking the dongle out the box. So it's mostly good news in the hardware stuff on the outside of the three new colors total I like matte black everything, but if you're debating between the three, I think the white will actually show the leaf scratches for what that's worth so then around the front. That'S obviously, where things start to get interesting, pixel, three and pixel three XL have great screens objectively. Their panels are made by Samsung this year and we all know how good Samsung is at screens it's a five point: five inch flexible OLED on the three and a six point, three inch on the three XL and both phones also now have two front facing cameras And a pair of big front-facing stereo speakers and the speakers are pretty good, but with a catch so I've compared them to iPhone 10's Macs and the razor phone some of the loudest speakers in any phone - and these are every bit as loud, if not louder, and They sound fuller and they definitely have more bass, but it just distorts a little bit at the highest volume and then they also vibrate the whole bottom of the phone at loud volumes. It'S not a problem at all. I just noticed like. I would feel it more than normal if I had loud music going in my hand, so then uh the notch at the top. It'S just you can't not talk about this screen without talking about the notch. It'S like a metaphor for the whole phone. You can't talk about this phone without talking about that notch. So the fact is, it doesn't really look like any other notch on any other phone. It has this face. It'S really tall, but the weird thing is: it's not actually really that much bigger than a lot of other notches. Here'S what I mean this is the iPhone 10s and the notch is just about the same volume as other notches, but it's narrower and taller. Instead of slimmer and wider, but this choice, assuming it was a choice, shifts the whole UI more down into the screen and you lose more of the top ears as they call it. That'S just losing screen real estate. This, my friends, is what we call in the business a poor use of space. Do they absolutely have to go with this tall of a notch? I don't know, Google didn't really tell us, they didn't really emphasize anything about it in the keynote. Obviously like, were they so set on having two front facing cameras and a big speaker that they had to go with this tall notch, or were they so set on this tall notch that they figured they might as well, throw in two cameras and a front-facing speaker? I don't know, but it is what it is. The truth is a week into using this phone. I don't pay attention to the notch anymore, like every other phone. I'Ve used with a notch, but I still want it to go away. I still want it to be smaller, I'm basically hoping notches and smart phones are a temporary hurdle and we're kind of over it by 2020 or 2022. Maybe that's just me being optimistic, but until then, if you absolutely cannot deal with a notch, you can either get the smaller pixel three and deal with a smaller phone with a smaller battery, or you can hide the notch by ticking the developer. Setting that permanently blocks out the top notch section, your call, so I could talk for a while about performance and smoothness of Android on this phone, but the bottom line is it's good, that's the short of it. Google knows how to tune their own Android phone. It'S well optimized, and this is gon na - be one of the only phones with Android P for a while now on the four gigs of RAM I'll get to that in a second, but just the overall smoothness and performance of pixel. Three has been great I'd say: my biggest complaint with the software is probably just the gestures. Honestly, I've done an entire separate video on all the new stuff with Android P, including these gestures, which were optional at the time. But now this is the only navigation option and you're forced to get used to it, which I am, but I still don't prefer it. So that's just me, but then past that pixel has all kinds of little software tricks and smart features, possibly making this the smartest smartphone I've ever used. Google lens identifying things in front of the camera all the time. That'S smart, they're now playing feature. I love this it'll tell you what song is playing in the background of whatever room or car you're in without you having to ask, and it keeps a rolling history of it. That'S smart and of course, just Google assistant in general, absolutely useful and call screen call screen is super good. I think we've all noticed at some point. There seems to be more spam calls happening at least to me. I'Ve noticed it so, when you're receiving an incoming call on pixel 3 with call screen, you can either accept, reject or screen the call with Google assistant, and when you do, Google assistant picks up the phone call hi. The person you're calling is using a screening service from Google and will get a copy of this conversation go ahead and say why you're calling yeah I'm the UPS guy and I'm downstairs yes, if you don't answer, then I have to bring this 20/20 Mac Pro back To the factory, so basically the live transcription. It'S great. It lets me know immediately if it's just a spammer robot calling and I can hang up or market a spam or if it's a real person, but actually found most real people. When they hear that Google assistant voice, they either immediately hang up or they think it's a voicemail, they leave a voicemail and then they hang out. So if I didn't catch what they said, as they were saying it, then when they hang up, the live transcription disappears. So my one suggestion for Google would be to let me like have a saved copy of that live transcription in case they just hang up the battery life on the pixel 3, pretty unremarkable very average. Actually, I'm averaging maybe four to four and a half hours of screen on time for my high brightness use for those counting. But your mileage may vary, but basically don't expect this to go like all day and then some it's definitely a one day phone, but again, wireless charging is welcome. I'M doing it a lot more now with my primary device now that it supports it. I'Ve also had some conversations with Google about things that I was complaining about before, like things that weren't optimized, yet bugs they've already promised that they're going to fix my complaint in the last video, which was the fact that full screen videos, weren't centered on pixel 3xl They'Re gon na change that so that's awesome shows they're listening. So while we're at it here's a couple other things that aren't quite right, so Instagram still needs to update their stories. Yahoo, fantasy app is still cut off at the top, and so is the YouTube studio, and I've also had this bug with background apps that I can try to demo. So this bug I've had - I don't know if it'll do it now, but we'll see I'll, be in a music, app playing music and a lot of times I'm connected to Bluetooth. Whatever it's supposed to be playing in the background, then I'll open, the camera app and I'll just take one photo and a lot of times. That'S enough to close the music app in the background and completely stop it from playing not only like pausing music but closing it, and I have to reopen it and the track starts over it's a weird. It seems like a memory thing. I kind of wonder if this would still happen with six or eight gigs of RAM, maybe it wouldn't, but maybe it's just an easily fixable book. Alright, I've made you wait long enough. Let'S get to the last big puzzle, piece of this phone, one of the big reasons you're all probably here, and one of the reasons this phone has been so hyped among content creators, youtubers people like that. It'S this camera, so Google's stuck with one camera on the back in a world where we literally have multiple phones coming out with three or four cameras on the back and Google is super stubborn with one, but as they should, because their software and their image processing Is everything so I'll just say it's straight-up pixel three takes the best photos of any smartphone camera better than iPhone 10s, better than red hydrogen better than any Samsung or any LG phone better than pixel two. But I don't want to just tell you that it's good. I want to tell you why it's good pixel three photos have eight Plus detail: a plus dynamic range, a Plus autofocus and now even better warmer, I think more accurate colors pixel to tend it to be a little bit cool. The sensor is big enough that you can pretty often create a real natural shallow depth of field when you take a photo of something close enough, so you don't need to use portrait mode very often, but when you do use portrait mode, the Edit detection is getting Better every year - and it's excellent at this point - so the typical photo for one pixel three camera - has a super strong dynamic range. It stacks sharp from corner to corner, which is my kind of camera. My only complaint would be sometimes the HDR can feel too aggressive. Like you know, that effect, when you have an overdone HDR, which can kind of look like a halo around the high contrast areas, that's hard to edit out, and so you got to retake the photo when that happens, but other than that. There'S not a lot to dislike about pixel 3s camera. It has me confident, as I'm taking photos that they're going to be good, no matter what and none of that like AI, tweaking the colors after you take the photo stuff, no over processing, it's just a good camera, and on top of all of that, there are Some other smart features that they've added this year so motion autofocus is particularly good. You tap something on the screen and it locks focused basically on that object and tracks it around the frame. It. Not only does it work well, but it's like an added confidence booster, that what you're gon na take a photo of will stay in focus super resume, which I was pretty hyped for, didn't turn out that drastic. I don't actually use digital zoom that much, but I found that when I do go past about 5x things start to get kind of watercolor II like a like a watercolor painting. I'M not sure if super resume is actually preserving any extra detail here. In fact, side by side with the iPhone 10s at full zoom, it looks like the iPhone preserves more detail which I guess you'd expect when it has a telephoto lens. So yeah it's a cool concept in theory, but I think it still needs some work to actually catch up to optical zoom. It might be a while, but I will say from like 1 X, 2 3 X, zoom pixel, pretty much always looks great and then of course, for selfie takers. Pixel 3 has absolutely the best selfie camera I have ever seen. Selfie portrait mode is really good and, of course, having a second, even wider angle. Camera is gon na. Let you get more on the shot, whether it's more people or more background or whatever you're into, but just generally, not a whole lot of beauty mode. It tack sharp what-you-see-is-what-you-get and then in the video front it's still a mixed bag. I still say iPhone is the best video camera in any smartphone. As long as pixel three doesn't have 4k 60 and it still has slightly more washed out colors and somewhat inconsistent exposure. But it's still pretty good. Stabilization is absolutely impeccable. This this is actually a handheld shot, but it looks like it's on a tripod which is ridiculous, but the microphone is still not that great. So if you were thinking about vlogging with this smartphone, yet this probably isn't the one overall, though, as a single camera system, pixel 3 is really impressive. It'S just a masterclass in computational photography and just how much software really matters in 2018. So basically, I want to give a shout out to the Verge's review title, which I actually think pretty much nailed the best it paints. The picture that I agree with, which is the best camera in a smartphone, gets a better phone. The best camera gets a better phone. If you scroll out in the comment section right now, I pretty much guarantee the first three comments. All have the word notch in them pretty much guarantee it go ahead, scroll down, see for yourself. It'S like a catch-22: if all we do is talk about this knotch every time the phone comes up, then we kind of have to ignore how good the rest of the phone is. But if we don't talk about the knotch, then they might get the idea that we like the notch or that we're into it, which were not so how good this phone is will be overshadowed by how bad this notch is. That'S the way it's gon na be, and that's everyone's fault. That'S our fault. That'S Google's fault for making it this way. That'S reviewers fault! That'S common tourists faults! It'S everyone's fault. I don't think Google cares. If this phone sells much. I think what they do care about. Is flexing what they're good at which at this point, is software machine learning and AI? And if you can see that and appreciate it, then you'll like this phone. You should get this phone for the camera and/or the software they're both best in class and beyond that. There isn't any really huge reason to get this phone, but it's true. The best camera just got a better phone, and I'm really happy about that, so I'll be carrying this phone. For that reason, for now anyway, that's the review until the next one, thanks for watching catch the late pace, """
naIaW4pk_-o,Apple Watch Series 4 Review: It's About Time!,9:47,"[ Applause, ], hey what is up guys I'm PhD here and I've always carried an iPhone with me, as you guys already know, but I've never been much of a watch person like I've gone on and off with a bunch of different smartwatches over the years that I'Ve tried the original moto 360 previous generations of Apple watch, even the new Samsung Galaxy watch that just came out, but always on and off with them. I'Ve never been consistent with it. This one looks like it might be changing that this is debatably. The best thing Apple announced at that latest event, the biggest upgrade for sure, and while I was there, I spent all my time with the phones. But now I've gone to spend a lot of time with the watches over the past couple days, and I got ta say it's about time. We got something like this. So series 4 is the first real redesign of the Apple watch and it's massively better in a lot of ways: more powerful, more modern, more functional and just more fun. It comes in two new sizes. The previous small 38 millimeter has turned into a 40 mil and the large 42 millimeter has turned into a 44 mil, so I'm rocking the new larger one in Space, Gray, aluminum and it's low-key way nicer than the series 3. Now. Naturally, when you hear it's bigger, you'd be concerned about the watch being too big on your wrist, but basically the actual size of the watch itself is nearly the same like a couple: fractions of a millimeter taller and a bit wider. But on the wrist, you don't noticed it's like if you like, the old size you'll like the new size, but thanks to the bezels shrinking so much you get a way bigger screen a 30 % bigger screen area in the same size, body no, not needed. That is HUGE. Every SmartWatch deals with bezels in some way, and this is a great way to do it. It also does have rounded corners which I'm not as big of a fan of, but it matches the shape of the watch. Now and overall, it's a less bulky, thinner, more modern, looking piece, it's a bit thinner in that sensor area on the back too, and all the changes put together make every previous Apple watch look terrible in comparison. This is the first Apple watch that, to me actually looks pretty sleek. There are some other minor cosmetic changes to this is the LTE connected watch and that huge red of paint from the last gen has turned into a more subtle red ring. The sensor array on the back - even they don't necessarily look at it - that much is now ceramic and looks way better. The mic has moved from one side to the other, so it's further from the speaker, that's functionally better and the speaker is now made way bigger. But overall it's still familiar Apple watch shape and the bands from the previous year's are all still compatible with this new one and using the watch. Software is now the same, but better meaning. It'S now watch OS 5, which all Apple watches are getting now and functionally. It'S the same, it doesn't do anything different, it's still the bubbly app launcher all that stuff hasn't changed, but it's now better. So it's on this larger display already and then they've made all the buttons bigger and easier to press and all the fonts and texts larger and easier to read. So it just makes the working surface area of the watch so much bigger on your wrist. To the point where it's actually not a horrible thing to pull out Maps or open photos up on the watch, you can actually kind of see stuff. Now, if someone sends you a link, an iMessage and you open it on the watch, you might not hate trying to read it and Apple, showing off these huge new displays. The best way they can with some new watch faces that happen to look super good on an OLED display, of course, with these inky blacks. But there's a lot of that by design there's the infograph watch face they've, seen like in the ads and all this new promo material. It has a ton of complications in all four corners and then four more in the middle plus an hour and a minute hand, and it's just a ton of information. I happen to like it a lot. It'S the one. I'Ve been using. Some people absolutely hate it. It'S like a crime against design by the amount of colors people, see it's kind of meant to emulate those super high-end watches with tons of visible mechanical parts, but a sort of a more digital and more colorful version. I got the temperature in one corner, my battery and another the UV index outside. I don't check that or care about that and my activity rings. I don't know it just kind of looks cool. I like it. I don't know why you can definitely tune it down them and there's also now a new infograph modular face. That'S a more digital version that still has a lot of complications with a similar gradient. Color style teach their own there's. Also, a new vapor watch face and a fire watch face and a water one, and these were all made. This is this - is the part that the video nerd in me absolutely loves. These were all made using practical effects and recorded with an actual camera, so they actually made a giant Apple watch, sized bin of metal with a camera over it and filled it with fire and recorded it fun fact, and probably the most gratuitous Apple thing ever. I love it so the bigger screen and the new design I'd say those are the main draw the biggest reasons to get this new watch. But I'd say there are two other reasons: one the new specs, it's a bit faster, which helps the s4 chip helps swiping through the UI, which you don't do nearly as often as you do on your phone, but it used to be painful on the watch. So I'm grateful that they focused on they can it smooth? Now, switching between watch faces adjusting complications, scrolling launching apps, all that and launching Siri is actually noticeably faster and getting responses from her is snappy. There'S also now just raised to talk, so you can raise the watch up and immediately just start talking and it'll quickly. Hopefully, answer your question: if you're asking one so how tall is the Empire State Building when it doesn't work, though it kind of just looks like you check the time and then just started blurting out words, which is probably not the best look, so I definitely still Prefer like holding down the watch crown and and holding and talking and letting go, even though it takes an extra hand and an extra second. So how many feet is a hundred meters? It'S fast, you could probably also just hear. Then the speaker is actually a lot louder, the big slot on the side. I'D say it's significant. So if you're, one of those people that makes a lot of phone calls on the watch or like gets a lot of responses from Syria or just talking to it a lot or even does walkie-talkies, then that that louder speaker will matter which brings us to your Final reason you might want to get this watch and that's just the sprinkling of new features Apple tossed in here and they're, like the new walkie-talkie mode, is maybe the most gimmicky thing ever. But in case you want to talk to people on your watch, but don't want to call them. There is a walkie-talkie mode that you can enable that lets you push the talk over and with that throwback to Nextel and the 90s. I think that falls in the bucket of old people are gon na love. This features alongside fall, detection and EKGs fall. Detection is exactly what it sounds like, so it is, after all, an accelerometer and a gyroscope on your wrist, so Apple tuned. This and studied a lot of people falling and with that, if you take a hard fall and then don't move for a while, it will automatically call emergency services and notify your emergency contact, which is actually pretty smart and I'd, say an Apple watch for someone is Way, cooler than the pendant of Shame, you normally see for fall detection, but also construction, workers and painters, and many other people who work at Heights will love this too, of course, and the EKG feature is actually extremely impressive. It'S not enabled yet, but when it is, you'll be able to just hold down the watch crown and it will connect the circuit and the watch can accurately read your heart and produce an EKG that you can then export as a PDF and send directly to your Doctor and it'll detect things like irregular heart rhythm, a fib. This is a feature that, when it's available could legitimately save lives, so the new Apple watch has a lot of things going for it, but it's not all great there's. Definitely it's still very Apple. In a couple frustrating ways, meaning there are some things that they could definitely do with it. That would clearly make it better, but they just don't do there. There is no sleep tracking at all, which you would think would be kind of a big deal in a watch. That'S so focused on health and fitness, but it's not there. There'S also still no completely custom watch faces, just the customization of the ones Apple made now to be fair. Apples made a lot at this point, but I feel like if Apple opened this up to developers and had an app store for watch faces, it could be huge right. You still can't use any assistant other than siri. Of course, i'm not surprised by that, but if i could switch it to google assistant, i would be so happy. There'S also no always-on mode that i think they could totally do with this battery life, and these OLED displays it is as consistent as ever with the whole race to wake thing, but a lot of people. I'Ve talked to you want it to look more like a normal watch, even when you're not using it, and part of that would just be showing a watch face all the time now. That would definitely bring battery life down. But it's already two to three days that I get now so it bring it down to maybe one day and that's not the end of the world. I'D think it would be fair to give that as an option, but at the end of the day, this is the best Smart Watch by far all over again and obviously the one to get. If you have an iphone, it's the best productivity watch, the best for notifications and responses to them. The best fitness watch the best health tool on your wrist. Now the price ranges a lot based on what size, what material and then whether you go with LTE or not, ranging from 399 all the way up to like you could spend 8 900 bucks. On this thing, I wouldn't recommend that, but yeah overall, I just feel like I've always been in this weird place. Where I know I carry an iPhone and I've always been a fan of the Apple watch, but I never feel like I'm missing out on anything when I just don't have one, but this one, I'm gon na keep on me, I'm pretty sure biggest upgrade to the Apple watch yet, and I love it and I think if you're looking for an Apple watch, you will too thumbs up for me till the next one. Thanks for watching catch you later peace, """
YAF9BWpzwvI,Apple iPhone Xs Review: A (S)mall Step Up!,12:00,"Hey what's up guys and qHD here and welcome to the iPhone 10s for review, so this is gon na be pretty easy review, since we know that the s year, iPhones are always a pretty incremental upgrade. So I've been using this gold 10s Mac's from the unboxing. Every day since keynote day and everything I say here will apply to both the 10s and the 10s Mac's, unless I say otherwise I'll make it clear. So the template here will be simple: every single thing that's new and what I think of it also 10s. Max 10s extra small Mac's, terrible name just saying: okay moving on so first up on the outside this phones, almost exactly the same. Almost if I were to put the iPhone 10s next to the iPhone 10, you have a hard time telling, which is which, except for a few key things. First of all, the new color, of course, gold, and I kind of dig this gold. This has been a more actually polarizing color in my timeline, where I've seen some people that love it and then some people that are like not amused by it at all. I just kind of don't mind it, but I definitely went for the Space Gray on my personal phone, but this goal doesn't look bad, it's kind of like a band-aid color, but more saturated a little more rich than that, and then the stainless steel sides are like Really gold they're the most striking part of this new phone and the iPhone 10's also has two more visible antennae on the stainless steel band around the outside one, at the top right above the camera module and one down at the bottom kind of cutting into the Speaker grille, so the speaker grille at the bottom, is actually now asymmetrical. Thanks to that bottom band, that is a weird look. You would think of all companies. Apple would find a different place to put that to keep it perfectly good looking, but I guess not and then the other little observation I found the camera module of the 10 s seems to be slightly larger, but it's very slight. The only way you can tell is, if you put a case on the phone, so if you put a 10 s case on a 10 s, you can see it fits perfectly. It'S very snug. It'S made by Apple. They know the exact dimensions they get it right, but if you put this same 10 s case on the iPhone 10, you actually end up with this little gap around the bottom, so the extra room means the camera module here is a bit smaller on the 10. So yeah technically this phones aren't quite the same exactly on the outside, but these couple of things don't really matter much to using it. It'S still a glass sandwich phone still the same weight and feel in the hand, same design, same button, placement, same mute, switch same curved corners, same notch and same fingerprint, magnet glass we've seen this before it, of course also means it's perfectly smart to put a case Or a skin on this one again, you already know: I'm more of a skin person and D brand is actually launching this absolutely sick, matte black matrix skin, with this new iPhone right now definitely worth checking out I'll drop. A link below oh and one more hardware. Difference technically internally, this new phone is ip68 water-resistant, where the iPhone 10 was just ip67. It'S a it's a big deal, so those of you who don't know IP 67 means you're rated for 1 meter underwater for 30 straight minutes. Ip68 means you're rated for 1.5 meters. Underwater for 33 minutes great anyway, all the other differences of the iPhone 10s are internal and that's what you get with an S upgrade, but honestly, that's what a lot of people were waiting for, you're, getting the best or newest design Apple has with their best specs. As well so this year as you've heard it's the new 7 nanometer 6 core a12 Bionic chip and four gigs of ram in both phones, it's not like one has less RAM than the other they're both set, and it ended up with some pretty damn good Geekbench Scores - and they said it's 15 to possibly 30 % faster in some actions like opening apps, opening the keyboard launching the camera. Things like that, and I can verify that this is an extremely fast phone. As a matter of fact, I think it brings it right back up to the king of responsiveness. As far as smart phones go, it was getting kind of passed up a little bit with Android phones of the past couple years, but iOS 12 is so buttery that it's back on the throne, but here's the thing that iOS 12 update is also extremely fast. On. Last year's iPhone 10 - in fact, I am not noticing like a major difference in speed between iPhone 10 with iOS 12 and iPhone 10s with iOS 12. It'S definitely performing great. Don'T get me wrong, but the fact that my year-old iPhone 10 running that iOS 12 beta for a while and now on the final version was already noticeably faster than iOS. 11 was a big deal, it's kind of like a curse. Apples put on themselves this time for actually maintaining and updating their phones this time in a way that makes the phone faster makes people with an older phone now like more satisfied and less likely to upgrade. The real interesting part here is with the bugs. I was getting especially in the 10s max with iOS 12. I'M pretty sure it's because of the new resolution, but a lot of apps that I use on the daily had a bunch of like overlapping, graphics or woodcut parts off in the notch where they weren't supposed to. I couldn't even read the caption. I was typing on Instagram, it was fully hidden in the knotch, but I'm pretty sure a lot of the stuff will be fixed pretty quickly, as phones come out and they developed for the new resolution. None of it was actually crashing or ruining the phone. It'S just weird graphic quirks, so the only place I actually feel the iPhone 10's actually seems a bit faster is face ID, and it's not even that much crazy faster. I definitely think the pause to unlock your phone is a bit shorter, which is nice to see. Maybe 25 % faster thanks to the a12 Bionic and iOS 12, but it's still, obviously not as fast as those crazy, quick ones from oneplus or chamois that are just using the RGB cameras and again it will always be slower than those because it will also always Be more secure sort of an inverse relationship there, no biggie! I am personally hoping for fingerprint readers underneath the display glass in mainstream phones to become more of a thing with this next upcoming generation, like it's rumored that one plus 60 you may have, it is rumored that galaxy s 10 may have it and it's rumored that Iphone 11 or whatever it's called, may also have it next year, but not this time. Another small improvement is the much better speakers in the 10s they're a bit louder and clearer now and a stereo speaker effect is now actually really quite good. It'S still using that earpiece plus the bottom speaker to technically make a stereo pair, and this makes a difference for all kinds of the media, you're listening to or music or watching videos or shows, or even gaming. I'D say it went from having a decent speaker to a very good speaker set, and the battery is one of the tiniest improvements in my experience. There'S still one day, phones both of them, although now iOS 12 gives you actually screen on time. So I can tell you, with my whole week with the 10s Macs. I was consistently getting four to four and a half hours of screen on time lasting all day, very similar to iPhone 10, not markedly much better, definitely not worse, still, a great stand by phone. But otherwise, nothing too crazy to report here. Really, the shame is still how long it takes to charge these huge batteries with the slow charger include in the box. So then, last but not least, is probably the most hyped new upgrade for these phones. Aside from the specs, and that would be the cameras, the iPhone 10s and 10's max shared the exact same cameras and they're, a slight upgrade from the 10 physically they're, slightly larger new sensors, still 12 megapixels. The main one is F, 1.8 and they're. Now both optically stabilized and there's a quad LED flash. Now this upgrade, I think, puts it firmly right up behind pixel 2 as the second best smartphone camera. It'S a it's a real upgrade from the iPhone 10 and every other iPhone actually a little more than I was expecting and generally the photos are great as you'd expect, and I think the biggest change is the more aggressive and better HD are thanks to their smart Hdr, so the colorscience is really good. A plus colors, a plus dynamic range, pretty much every photo is cornered. 1/4, sharp and low-light is pretty damn good too. I definitely want to get another side-by-side sort of test going got to get this iPhone alongside pixel 3 when it comes out probably red hydrogen and some other top dogs, because obviously the minor difference comes down to opinion but confirmed this is an amazing smartphone camera right Out the box now you may have heard some talk about this improved portrait mode as well. Portrait mode on the iPhone started out kind of nearly as a joke. It was in this beta. It was pretty hacked together and sloppy at the beginning, but every year it gets better and better, like I wish Siri would, and this year it takes another leap. So portrait mode with these dual cameras uses the difference in distance between the cameras and Apple's software to create a depth map. You might have heard that before so it kind of segments the image into different layers of different distances from the camera. So when you blur the background of a photo with portrait mode, instead of just drawing sort of a crude mask around the foreground and then applying a big blur to the whole background, this portrait mode is actually blurring the parts further away from the camera. More while blurring the closer parts, less it's much more realistic and closer to what a real bokeh from a bigger camera looks like it's a subtle difference, but it's a massive improvement again from the first versions of portrait mode. So you take a portrait mode photo. You go into this editing and you get this slider for changing the depth of field after the fact. Only iPhone 10s and 10's Macs will do this right off the bat people compared it to Samsung's live focus because, of course that's what it reminds us of. But when I compare them side-by-side the whole generic blur of the Samsung versus the Selective blur that keeps getting better. It'S pretty clear to me, which one I prefer, and even though this is all purely software blur just mimicking a bigger camera. It even seems to be adding a slight direction to the blur, like a sort of radial blur around the center of the frame, which is pretty impressive. So I don't use portrait mode very much because it's still hit or miss, but these improvements mean when it does hit. It can be pretty damn good, also combine that with the fact that it's still the best video recording in a smartphone as well at 4k, 60 plus they've added stereo audio recording to support the speakers, and it all adds up to a pretty powerful camera. As we've come to expect from an iPhone, so that's where we're at you specs new camera, same software same design, so this iPhone 10s is everything we thought it would be really honestly the main upgrade. If you want to call it that would have to be the 10s max the much bigger screen. This is the iPhone I've been using by choice for the past couple days, and it really does feel like a very different iPhone. A six and a half inch display in a body smaller than a galaxy. No 9, I mean that's all you really have to say to make it my favorite iPhone ever, but there are so many advantages to having a bigger screen. I'Ve talked about them in previous big phone videos, and all of those still hold up with the big iPhone watching videos is better. Gaming is definitely better. Basically, anything that involves wanting a nice viewing experience is improved. I'Ve been a big phone person as long as I can remember, and so naturally, the bigger iPhone is my favorite iPhone and I just never thought I'd see a day where the iPhone is closer to the size of an iPad Mini than the original iPhone. But that's what we got here: there are downsides of being a huge phone. You can't forget them, and I've said this again about other big phones, the much bigger space it takes up in your pocket or your purse or wherever you keep it, and it's way less likely to be a one-handed phone for most people, let's be real. Routability is gon na be way more important on this bigger phone than it ever has been, but that's what's up. This upgrade to me is all about the size of this 10 s max. If you have an iPhone 10, I can tell you right now: you don't need an iPhone 10 s, you're fine! Even if you have $ 1000 hole in your pocket and you've been itching for a faster iPhone and a better camera upgrade to iOS 12 and by and rx100 with that money, it's a much better camera boom problem solved. Really. The iPhone 10s is great upgrade for people who have an older, iPhone and iPhone seven or eight or even older than that, then again, so will probably be. The iPhone 10 are so off to get that in house and see if that's about it in the full review, but I have no problem recommending the iPhone 10s for those people, but really, if you've been waiting for a bigger iPhone for all the mentions. I talked about and you have the money it's expensive just like last year, but if you're one of those people like me, then this is definitely the way to go. I'M a fan of the 10s Macs and I recommend it give it a shot either way. That'S been it thanks for watching Tachi as the next one peace """
ZVoaNzRo0uo,The Truth About the Pocophone F1!,9:32,"Hey what's up guys and qHD here and welcome to the iPhone 10s for review, so this is gon na be pretty easy review, since we know that the s year, iPhones are always a pretty incremental upgrade. So I've been using this gold 10s Mac's from the unboxing. Every day since keynote day and everything I say here will apply to both the 10s and the 10s Mac's, unless I say otherwise I'll make it clear. So the template here will be simple: every single thing that's new and what I think of it also 10s. Max 10s extra small Mac's, terrible name just saying: okay moving on so first up on the outside this phones, almost exactly the same. Almost if I were to put the iPhone 10s next to the iPhone 10, you have a hard time telling, which is which, except for a few key things. First of all, the new color, of course, gold, and I kind of dig this gold. This has been a more actually polarizing color in my timeline, where I've seen some people that love it and then some people that are like not amused by it at all. I just kind of don't mind it, but I definitely went for the Space Gray on my personal phone, but this goal doesn't look bad, it's kind of like a band-aid color, but more saturated a little more rich than that, and then the stainless steel sides are like Really gold they're the most striking part of this new phone and the iPhone 10's also has two more visible antennae on the stainless steel band around the outside one, at the top right above the camera module and one down at the bottom kind of cutting into the Speaker grille, so the speaker grille at the bottom, is actually now asymmetrical. Thanks to that bottom band, that is a weird look. You would think of all companies. Apple would find a different place to put that to keep it perfectly good looking, but I guess not and then the other little observation I found the camera module of the 10 s seems to be slightly larger, but it's very slight. The only way you can tell is, if you put a case on the phone, so if you put a 10 s case on a 10 s, you can see it fits perfectly. It'S very snug. It'S made by Apple. They know the exact dimensions they get it right, but if you put this same 10 s case on the iPhone 10, you actually end up with this little gap around the bottom, so the extra room means the camera module here is a bit smaller on the 10. So yeah technically this phones aren't quite the same exactly on the outside, but these couple of things don't really matter much to using it. It'S still a glass sandwich phone still the same weight and feel in the hand, same design, same button, placement, same mute, switch same curved corners, same notch and same fingerprint, magnet glass we've seen this before it, of course also means it's perfectly smart to put a case Or a skin on this one again, you already know: I'm more of a skin person and D brand is actually launching this absolutely sick, matte black matrix skin, with this new iPhone right now definitely worth checking out I'll drop. A link below oh and one more hardware. Difference technically internally, this new phone is ip68 water-resistant, where the iPhone 10 was just ip67. It'S a it's a big deal, so those of you who don't know IP 67 means you're rated for 1 meter underwater for 30 straight minutes. Ip68 means you're rated for 1.5 meters. Underwater for 33 minutes great anyway, all the other differences of the iPhone 10s are internal and that's what you get with an S upgrade, but honestly, that's what a lot of people were waiting for, you're, getting the best or newest design Apple has with their best specs. As well so this year as you've heard it's the new 7 nanometer 6 core a12 Bionic chip and four gigs of ram in both phones, it's not like one has less RAM than the other they're both set, and it ended up with some pretty damn good Geekbench Scores - and they said it's 15 to possibly 30 % faster in some actions like opening apps, opening the keyboard launching the camera. Things like that, and I can verify that this is an extremely fast phone. As a matter of fact, I think it brings it right back up to the king of responsiveness. As far as smart phones go, it was getting kind of passed up a little bit with Android phones of the past couple years, but iOS 12 is so buttery that it's back on the throne, but here's the thing that iOS 12 update is also extremely fast. On. Last year's iPhone 10 - in fact, I am not noticing like a major difference in speed between iPhone 10 with iOS 12 and iPhone 10s with iOS 12. It'S definitely performing great. Don'T get me wrong, but the fact that my year-old iPhone 10 running that iOS 12 beta for a while and now on the final version was already noticeably faster than iOS. 11 was a big deal, it's kind of like a curse. Apples put on themselves this time for actually maintaining and updating their phones this time in a way that makes the phone faster makes people with an older phone now like more satisfied and less likely to upgrade. The real interesting part here is with the bugs. I was getting especially in the 10s max with iOS 12. I'M pretty sure it's because of the new resolution, but a lot of apps that I use on the daily had a bunch of like overlapping, graphics or woodcut parts off in the notch where they weren't supposed to. I couldn't even read the caption. I was typing on Instagram, it was fully hidden in the knotch, but I'm pretty sure a lot of the stuff will be fixed pretty quickly, as phones come out and they developed for the new resolution. None of it was actually crashing or ruining the phone. It'S just weird graphic quirks, so the only place I actually feel the iPhone 10's actually seems a bit faster is face ID, and it's not even that much crazy faster. I definitely think the pause to unlock your phone is a bit shorter, which is nice to see. Maybe 25 % faster thanks to the a12 Bionic and iOS 12, but it's still, obviously not as fast as those crazy, quick ones from oneplus or chamois that are just using the RGB cameras and again it will always be slower than those because it will also always Be more secure sort of an inverse relationship there, no biggie! I am personally hoping for fingerprint readers underneath the display glass in mainstream phones to become more of a thing with this next upcoming generation, like it's rumored that one plus 60 you may have, it is rumored that galaxy s 10 may have it and it's rumored that Iphone 11 or whatever it's called, may also have it next year, but not this time. Another small improvement is the much better speakers in the 10s they're a bit louder and clearer now and a stereo speaker effect is now actually really quite good. It'S still using that earpiece plus the bottom speaker to technically make a stereo pair, and this makes a difference for all kinds of the media, you're listening to or music or watching videos or shows, or even gaming. I'D say it went from having a decent speaker to a very good speaker set, and the battery is one of the tiniest improvements in my experience. There'S still one day, phones both of them, although now iOS 12 gives you actually screen on time. So I can tell you, with my whole week with the 10s Macs. I was consistently getting four to four and a half hours of screen on time lasting all day, very similar to iPhone 10, not markedly much better, definitely not worse, still, a great stand by phone. But otherwise, nothing too crazy to report here. Really, the shame is still how long it takes to charge these huge batteries with the slow charger include in the box. So then, last but not least, is probably the most hyped new upgrade for these phones. Aside from the specs, and that would be the cameras, the iPhone 10s and 10's max shared the exact same cameras and they're, a slight upgrade from the 10 physically they're, slightly larger new sensors, still 12 megapixels. The main one is F, 1.8 and they're. Now both optically stabilized and there's a quad LED flash. Now this upgrade, I think, puts it firmly right up behind pixel 2 as the second best smartphone camera. It'S a it's a real upgrade from the iPhone 10 and every other iPhone actually a little more than I was expecting and generally the photos are great as you'd expect, and I think the biggest change is the more aggressive and better HD are thanks to their smart Hdr, so the colorscience is really good. A plus colors, a plus dynamic range, pretty much every photo is cornered. 1/4, sharp and low-light is pretty damn good too. I definitely want to get another side-by-side sort of test going got to get this iPhone alongside pixel 3 when it comes out probably red hydrogen and some other top dogs, because obviously the minor difference comes down to opinion but confirmed this is an amazing smartphone camera right Out the box now you may have heard some talk about this improved portrait mode as well. Portrait mode on the iPhone started out kind of nearly as a joke. It was in this beta. It was pretty hacked together and sloppy at the beginning, but every year it gets better and better, like I wish Siri would, and this year it takes another leap. So portrait mode with these dual cameras uses the difference in distance between the cameras and Apple's software to create a depth map. You might have heard that before so it kind of segments the image into different layers of different distances from the camera. So when you blur the background of a photo with portrait mode, instead of just drawing sort of a crude mask around the foreground and then applying a big blur to the whole background, this portrait mode is actually blurring the parts further away from the camera. More while blurring the closer parts, less it's much more realistic and closer to what a real bokeh from a bigger camera looks like it's a subtle difference, but it's a massive improvement again from the first versions of portrait mode. So you take a portrait mode photo. You go into this editing and you get this slider for changing the depth of field after the fact. Only iPhone 10s and 10's Macs will do this right off the bat people compared it to Samsung's live focus because, of course that's what it reminds us of. But when I compare them side-by-side the whole generic blur of the Samsung versus the Selective blur that keeps getting better. It'S pretty clear to me, which one I prefer, and even though this is all purely software blur just mimicking a bigger camera. It even seems to be adding a slight direction to the blur, like a sort of radial blur around the center of the frame, which is pretty impressive. So I don't use portrait mode very much because it's still hit or miss, but these improvements mean when it does hit. It can be pretty damn good, also combine that with the fact that it's still the best video recording in a smartphone as well at 4k, 60 plus they've added stereo audio recording to support the speakers, and it all adds up to a pretty powerful camera. As we've come to expect from an iPhone, so that's where we're at you specs new camera, same software same design, so this iPhone 10s is everything we thought it would be really honestly the main upgrade.

ihEhAbVRC78,Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Review: The Total Package!,10:54,"Hey, what is up guys mkbhd here - and this is the samsung galaxy - note - 9, an absolute unit uh. This is that android phone again. That starts at a thousand bucks this year, which is making headlines again, it's a very expensive phone. I'Ve been using it since it came out since that impressions, video so for well over a week, and i got ta say i think it's worth it so last year i was talking about the five pillars of a great smartphone. So if you recall some of my previous reviews, i've had about five pillars of a great smartphone, those five and the one that the note 8 didn't have was great battery. But literally everything else about it was great and it's still one phone of the year. This year the note 9 upgrades literally everything about that phone and makes the biggest improvement to the battery. So it's getting a lot of flack for being just an incremental upgrade to the note 8, but i actually think that's one of the best. Compliments that you could give a phone right now. So what are those pillars again? You might be asking. They are great display, great, build quality, great performance, great camera and great battery life. I always say: if you check every single box, you got yourself a great quality. Smartphone, if we look at galaxy note 9 now it checks every single box and then some so the display is incredible. Some, including me, would even say it's literally the best display in any phone last year's note was already the best display in any phone this year. It'S 0.1 inches bigger and it's magnificently bright. You can read it outdoors in direct sunlight. It'S super, vibrant and contrasty and color accurate. This is an a plus display great for gaming, for watching videos and also no notch in case you forgot about that. The only downside to a display like this is how big it makes the phone feel i just came from the oneplus 6, as you know, with a smaller display and the pixel before that and using an iphone 10 a lot. So moving up to this note, it's one of the few phones that really makes me work hard to use it with one hand, and i prefer often to use it with two hands. And i don't say that about a lot of phones. So there's a lot of reaching to get up to the top of the display and then back down to the bottom and you're going to notice it. But then again, if you're getting a note, you already know what you're getting yourself into and sometimes that's just something. You got to calibrate for, but all in all great display, no question that gets a thumbs up and that kind of leads me into the second part, which is great, build quality with the infinity display, the kind of bleeding of the edge of the screen over samsung. Still does that it's recognizable versus other phones, that don't do this and i like it. They don't have to reinvent the wheel here. They found something that makes it feel really immersive and they just keep doing that. Well, but really, i think we just keep forgetting like the build quality, the industrial design or just generally, the hardware of this phone is one of the most underrated things about it. It'S really great, you have the premium build materials right, so you got metal all the way around. This is the new blue one that i actually kind of like a lot tight corners like really boxy as a phone, much more squared off than most, but i like that. They still have the rounded corners of the display, but not by a whole lot and then overall it just has this chiseled dense, look and feel, and it checks a lot of boxes. It'S ip68 water resistant. It has a headphone jack. It has excellent clicky buttons and i'll talk more about those in a bit and one of the more underrated upgrades to the hardware is the speakers they're in the same place as they were, but they're now much louder and fuller, sounding and just straight up better than Before i definitely appreciate that slight downside to the hardware is the glossy back that will 100 collect tons of fingerprints, as you can see as good as samsung's glass looks when it's clean it can get pretty clouded up, but obviously the easy fix you can drop a Dbrand skin on it, i may recommend a black skin specifically for this one, so you can rock a super clean black and yellow. Look with that s pen overall, this thing is built like a tank. Build quality is not a problem on the note 9. i'd even say it technically counts as a little bit of an upgrade because they move the fingerprint reader down just a little bit to be more reachable minor detail, but makes a difference when you're using it every Day but build quality is great, okay, so performance galaxy. Note 9 has been a great performer. It'S a fast high-end flagship, so you'd expect that snapdragon 845 and six gigs of ram here, etc. I'M always worried about samsung's skin, though, because it's not light. It'S kind of a lot: you worry about software updates with it, but from my use so far it's been smooth and snappy. It'S what i've come to expect and it's gotten one software update so far. Now this is the 128 gig version with six gigs of ram. I haven't yet gotten to try myself the 512 gig version with eight gigs of ram, but the thing about that. First of all, it's 250 bucks more expensive than the baseline version. So that's a lot and then i don't really see myself actually using 500 gigs of storage on a phone as amazing as it is. I love that it's an option. It'S 2018! Why not push that limit, but almost all the stuff i use as far as media music photos? This stuff is all cloud-based anyway, if you are the type of person to have an insane amount of local media and movies and games whatever it is you're doing there can only be one phone. That'S offering this half a terabyte of storage. Right now i mean maybe two or three, but that's what node is all about giving you these power user features, plus an extra two gigs of ram doesn't hurt, but i think pretty much. Anyone, including me, will be fine with the 128.6 and then there is also a new cooling system to mention so zack jerry rig everything he tore into his note 9 and showed the much bigger copper heat pipe inside this phone samsung calls it a water carbon cooling System - all i can tell you is just from using it. This phone definitely still gets a little bit warm on the back, especially when gaming for a while or navigating in a warm window of your dashboard or something like that, but definitely never overheated. It is for sure, a great gaming phone, though it has the specs and more to keep up and the most incredible display and some upgraded speakers. So that's still a solid combo, and so then there is the camera or cameras and uh. This is a this. Is a firmly third place camera as far as smartphones go right now, which is pretty awesome, i mean you got pixel 2 at the top, which is amazing. Then you got this and iphone 10 right around. Second and third, you can watch the blind test, video, if you don't believe me, but this is essentially the exact same camera setup as the galaxy s9 plus from a couple months ago, which makes it an upgrade from the last note. So just like the s9 plus, you give it a lot of light and it is an excellent camera. You can get real shallow depth of field if you get close enough to your subject as they're, pretty classic samsung, vibrant colors and slight over processing. As far as sharpening and noise reduction, you've already heard this all from me before the one new addition is the ai in the settings which they call a scene optimizer that will automatically adjust certain colors when it recognizes the subject so with flowers it might boost the Warmer colors or with landscapes, it might boost the blue of the sky, but i found this more inconsistent and annoying to me than useful, so i turned it off after a while, but what i do think was useful is what they called flaw: detection or basically, if Someone blinks or the photos blurry or it finds a red eye or something's messed up in some way. It'Ll. Let you know right away, so you can take another one that part's cool but overall yeah, so galaxy note 8 had a great camera, then galaxy s9 and s9 plus had great camera. Now we got note 9 still great camera. So that brings us to what you were all probably wondering about from the beginning, which is the battery the note 9 bumps up to a 4 000 milliamp hour battery, which is a pretty big jump from last year. Last year they were a little conservative. You know sort of following up on the heels of the problems they had, so they had a 3 300 milliamp hour battery in note 8.. So that's a plus 20 battery capacity size, that's not iterative. I know a lot of things. We'Ve said about this: phone have been iterative, that's not. That is a massive jump, but that's just on paper. So as far as actual life of the phone goes, it's not the best battery life of any phone that'll still go to phones with smaller screens. But note 9 is now comfortably lasting all day with a little extra room to spare, which it didn't do that before. So i'm getting around 5 hours of screen on time with most of my days, occasionally a little more, never really less, which, with my heavy usage, is pretty damn good, i'm going to say a minus grade battery that i was pretty happy with obviously having a massive 6.4 inch super bright display cranked on all the time is gon na take a toll on a phone, so we felt that last year with the big screen, i think four thousand milliamp hours is actually the appropriate battery size. For the galaxy note - and i don't think anyone getting it will be disappointed. This is great battery life so looks like they did it. They they, like, i said, literally, upgraded everything on paper about this phone from last year, which was already good. So i mean you got a better bigger brighter display. It'S great, you got great performance, you got great build quality, you got a great battery life and a great camera. Now, all in one phone and like the note always does it also has a ton of extras. Just because samsung has tons of features to throw in for people who are into that kind of stuff. Those are people who are buying the note, like all the different screen modes and advanced tinkering. Samsung throws in the settings for people who want to dial in the exact color balance and look of their displays things like that. It'S not it's clearly not flawless uh such a perfectly placed bixby button that can't be remapped. I can't ignore that. It'S a damn, shame! I just want to remap the bixby button to launch google or twitter or something else i want to do what you can't samsung. I thought you were about that and the s pen remote feature it works, and it's great. I i just don't see myself using it. All that much i don't do powerpoints from my phone or any presentations or stuff like that, so i still just use the s pen for just taking it out, jotting down a note and putting it away. You know the extra features are welcome and there will be people who love them and use them a lot, but turns out i'm just one of those people who uses stylus the way i always have. But for me, at the end of the day, honestly, i would have no problem using this phone every single day. It checks so many boxes. You can't really find another phone that does an incredible high-res oled display no notch ip68 water resistance, a headphone jack and then up to half a terabyte of flash storage, snapdragon 845. Eight gigs of ram expandable storage. On top of that, dual cameras, both with ois and a 4 000 milliamp hour battery, a thousand bucks - is a lot to spend on a phone. But if you're gon na spend a thousand bucks on one, this is for sure the one to get you're getting your money's worth and people who are looking into buying a note already know what they're getting themselves into and they're gon na love this. But if you're in the other side of that camp, if you're not a note person, if you're, if you're, already typing in the comments, a thousand bucks is way too much to spend on a phone. I would never do that. Then a phone like the galaxy s9 or s9 plus, which are several hundred dollars, less that's going to be the route for you to go so samsung's kind of offering the whole wealth of different budget options and you can choose - and i think you'll find something you Like in there, it's a good phone good job samsung until the next one. Thanks for watching talk to you guys later peace, you """
9gkxwIZPOZk,HTC U12+ Review: A Phone With No Buttons!,10:23,"You guys probably thought I forgot about this: one hey, what is up guys MTV HD here - and this is the HTC u12 plus so HTC has had a couple really interesting years, leading up to this new phone, and this turns out to be one of the only Flagships available in 2018 with no knotch and a couple super unique features, and the other thing is in the US or anywhere really this phones not going to be in stores. That may explain why you or someone you know hasn't really heard of this or you're hearing about it for the first time, not as much hype around the sky, but it will be available online for 849 bucks. So that's definitely high-end it's a premium flagship. So is it worth your money well, first of all, just as far as design, this is the translucent blue color. It'S the only color of this phone. I consider buying it in, as you can see that the glass is a little bit see-through in the top half, which I love. It'S not quite jerry-rigged everything fully seeing all the components see-through, but it's still pretty unique and I'm a fan of this I'd love to see other phones offer something similar to this too. There are some other colors available for this phone as well, but they aren't see-through. So who cares about them, but this is the glass back enabling this, of course, so the whole back of the phone is now this glass, it's much slipperier, but there's no wireless charging. So if you hated one plus we're going glass back but no wireless charging, then you have to paint this one too, but bottom line. I am a big fan of the way this one looks, even though it does catch plenty of finger prints. I think it is one of those where I would just not ever put a case or a skin on it. Just leave it the way it is the rest of this phone looks pretty normal, though for 2018, you know pretty simple design lots of HTC cues and shape, but you wouldn't suspect anything to stand out crazy, just looking at it, but there are actually a lot of Really interesting things about this phone. First of all, the squeeze is back and it's like leveled up. It still has the side squeeze sensitivity from the U 11, so you can set a shortcut to launch something when you squeeze the phone but also have different types of squeezes. So a quick squeeze is one thing and a long squeeze is a different shortcut, and on top of that, you have pressure sensitivity, all the way up the side, the phone so while you're holding it. If you double tap the side of the phone with your thumb, it acts as a shortcut to one handed mode and if you switch hands and DoubleTap with the other thumb, that's the other side shrinking to one-handed mode. So a lot of hand gymnastics. But it's being really smart about what it does with that pressure sensitivity. So that's pretty impressive: when it works, it's not always perfect, it can get pretty finicky and sometimes I tried an outright, doesn't work and there's a lot of ghost taps and it can fix itself after a while, but basically the only downside has been that it doesn't Always sense the tap, but then, on top of all of that, the most interesting part about this phone might not be the color might not be the pressure-sensitive squeezed feature. It'S that this phone doesn't actually have any real buttons. The power button and volume button on the side of this phone aren't normal clicky actuating buttons. There are even more pressure sensitive areas on the side of the phone, so when the phone is often you press the volume buttons, they don't move, you know kind of like apple's, solid-state touch ID home button, it's not an actual button until the phone turns on and When it is on there's a vibration motor that kicks in and simulates the feel of pressing a button when you squeeze or put pressure on that area, so, okay, how have these fake buttons played out in real-world use? Well, like I said, the best version of this would be Apple's haptic engine. Where have you pressed the home button on an iphone eight you're, fully convinced, usually that you're clicking an actual button. It still feels like you're, pressing something that clicks. This is a decidedly average vibration motor inside, so it's not nearly as convincing I've gotten used to it. I expect it now, when I press the button to have that feeling, but it's it's it's way. Worse, there's. Definitely a slight delay like when I press the home button versus when I actually feel the vibration that is supposed to simulate a click, there's a slight delay that makes it feel software driven rather than like the haptic engine being exactly when I click it. That'S the difference, it doesn't feel as real and it becomes really obvious when you try to double press any of these buttons like double tapping. The power button doesn't do anything double tapping. The volume buttons doesn't raise the volume twice. You have to really press it. Slowly, to actually get it to work, and this is not fun at all. This is not a good experience. I think, for some people this can be a deal-breaker in this phone. I personally still do prefer really good clicky buttons and I think I'll continue to praise them until haptic engines get way better, but this is probably the biggest downside of this phone. Okay, another unique thing about this phone. You may have already noticed the dual cameras on the back, but you also get two cameras up top here at the front. Selfie cameras - and these are just for portrait mode selfies and I was hoping I was hoping. One of them would be a regular camera and one of them would be a super wide-angle selfie camera. So you could take super wide angle selfies without having to do some corny stitching effect, but no. This is just the same focal length slightly separate from each other. To do better blur and bokeh for portrait mode, the actual bokeh effect isn't actually any better than average. I don't think something like a pixel or a galaxy s 9 or an iPhone are still hit or missed the same way. This one is with hair and faces, but it does a decent job, the main advantage, which we also see with Samsung with a single camera, but the main advantage is you can control the amount of background blur after you take the photo. So that's nice, plus all the other interesting stuff HTC usually throws in the selfie camera they're kind of like Samsung. They feel they need to go crazy with beauty mode. There are many different things you can do to your face in beauty mode, but you may or may not ever use those but yeah. Those are the main, unique things about the zone. That may not be obvious from the second. You pick it up. I'D say, the rest of this phone is normal for 2018. It'S a flagship that checks a lot of boxes. It has high-end specs and a pretty conservative, but likable design, its IP 68 water-resistant, which is great. The fingerprint reader is on the back in the middle again right where it should be excellent use of space high. It has a micro, SD card expansion slot, and it really has a lot of what people have been asking for. No notch thin side, bezels great, build great display high-end specs, quality, camera, etc. The only thing that's really missing is the headphone jack. Even the dual speakers are a nice upgrade, that's not boom sound or anything, but it's the one at the bottom plus the earpiece doubles as a front-facing channel. So you're not gon na accidentally block your audio very easily with this setup and they do get loud and sound full, and then it has a thirty five hundred million power battery which sounds like it should be plenty, but it's definitely not. It could have something to do with the display, so it is a 6 inch. 28 80 by 1440. Super LCD panel will work. It has something to do with H, see software, but I'm basically barely getting a day out of it. When I thought I'd be getting a day-and-a-half easily, it charges quick and that's nice. There'S no wireless charging like I said, but that's not a deal-breaker for me. I just wish the battery life was better to begin with. Maybe software can be improved. Maybe a software update. Can actually make that better, so that just leaves us with the software and the camera. The software is HTC Sense. So it's about what you'd expect and the camera is pretty good, so HTC Sense UI is on top of Android 8.0 Oreo and hopefully, with Android P. Coming very soon and I've never had a problem with HTC Sense. Really it's never been my favorite skin on top of Android, but it's also been pretty tame for a while. You still have blinkfeed to the side of the homescreen. You still get all these fancy. Looking icons with these shadows now and everything, there is a customizable second panel next to the navigation bar for shortcuts, which is pretty cool, but you can't add app shortcuts. I wish, I could add, a custom app down there if I wanted, but that would have been even cooler. They added face unlock, which everyone seems to be doing now, but I still prefer this phones fingerprint reader, which is great and there's even a smart, rotate feature which I love, which keeps the phone in portrait mode at all times. When it knows it's being gripped in portrait mode but lets it rotate when it's not being gripped that way, I think that's really cool. So it's mostly what you're used to from HTC here, pretty quiet, just tossing in a couple things here and there over the last couple years. You can still phim it, but there's no radical design changes here. It'S it's about what I expected and then on the back. The camera or cameras, like I said, are pretty good, so you're getting a 12 megapixel main shooter with F 1.75 aperture with optical image. Stabilization and your secondary is a telephoto, 16 megapixel, shooter, f, 2.6 with no OIS and the photos I've been taking they're. Not quite the best in any smartphone, but they do fit right in here with, I would say, a top 5 good detail and color and even a shallow depth of field and a kind of nice looking bokeh. If you get shallow enough, I think the cameras biggest flaw is that it tends to overexpose making things a little bit too bright and you'll notice. It doesn't have the best dynamic range, so you might lose a little bit of highlights, but overall I'm sure automatic metering can be adjusted and you can always do manual metering easily with slider, so I'm just being picky. I think this is a sneaky top five smartphone camera right now. I think right now, you're, clear top dogs are pixel to iPhone ten, and then this falls right in line with like Galaxy S, nine and I'd say better than one plus six, so yeah overall right now is a packaged. Htc u12 plus, is a flagship worthy of your consideration. You know it's SPECT, like a flagship. It'S definitely built like a flagship and it's price like a flagship, but as an overall package. It feels like this. This phone is like almost there it's it's. I mean, I guess, if you're a super anti notch, if you're one of those people that left a comment saying this phone has a notch, so I'll never buy it, then I guess your choices are like this and galaxy s 9, because this is one of the Few phones, without enough, but other than that, this phone legit checks a lot of boxes with a thumbs up and really only fall short in the buttons and the battery life like these buttons, I'm just barely okay with like I'm used to them now. But I feel like I'm not gon na, be happy about them in two or three years, but they are what they are, but it's the subpar battery life you got to think about and that experience that all comes with it and I think HTC is not always Tops or first to update their phones to the new OS, but fingers crossed they get to Android peace soon like they seem to have promised counting on you guys anyway. That'S it that's HTC, u12, plus you think you could rock a phone with no real buttons. Let me know what you think in the comments below I'll be hanging out there answering questions, of course, as usual. Thank you for watching doc. Together, the next one peace """
0PrUr3bQdwM,OnePlus 6 Review: Right On the Money!,11:52,"So this is a pretty great phone, so I've been using one plus six everyday now for about two weeks and it is absolutely daily driver material. I think people who buy it, who know what they're getting themselves into will like it, a lot and it's pretty easy to recommend. So that's right off the top. Really the more interesting part is reviewing. This phone for me has become an exercise in a study of the law of diminishing returns. The law of diminishing returns is a point at which the level of benefits gained is less than the amount of money or energy invested. So you see a 300 hour phone. You get a certain amount of value, then you spend 300 hours more and you get a lot more value. You spend 300 dollars more than that. You get a little more value and then you spend another $ 400 more and you get just a tiny bit more. So, honestly, the most important feature of the 1 plus 6 is the price. It starts at 529, bucks in this world of 7 800 $ 900,000 flagship, so they're kind of working in the reverse direction. Instead of pushing value as high as you possibly can. They'Re kind of thinking: how much can we cut off of the price without sacrificing a significant amount of value? How cheap can we make this phone and still make it great and every year one plus does this: they have to make this balance of things. They want to cut out versus things they want to keep, and I think this year, they've made a bunch of good choices and come out with a balanced budget performance beast. So this year is a 2018 version of that I'll. Give you the updates of what I found from my experience, which is most of it being positive and then I'll fill you went on the short cut, so the shavings they had to take because you don't get to this price without some of these. So on the outside, the build is legit awesome. The actual look of the phone might not speak to everyone, but I'm a fan of the midnight black here or the matte black version, while there's also a much glossy er much fingerprint here, mayor black and I was also a soft white coming soon. It has these awesome buttons. I love these clicky buttons. It has the alert, slider, that's firm and also clicky, and I was actually confusing it with the power button pretty early when I first got this phone just because of the placement it's kind of high, but after using it for a while, I stopped doing that and The whole phone has this nice wedge shape. Phones, don't necessarily have to be thin for me to like them, but this phone feels super solid with a lot of metal in there it has a headphone jack. It has a dual SIM card tray and it even has this subtle S shape when you see it in the frosted glass back, it's clean, so overall it honestly looks and feels quality. It has the slight bump in the back to the camera. That'S not really a big deal, but for the emissions there are some conscious choices that they made to leave out of this phone, that they're, hoping that you won't mind so much so ready for these there's, no expandable storage, just dual SIM cards, so no micro, SD Card expansion, the speaker situation is pretty weak. It just has this single downward facing speaker, which is the worst part of the phone's hardware. It'S pretty average at best kind of tinny at high volumes and there's no second speaker in a earpiece to make a stereo sound. So it's super easy to block this one by accident. I'Ve done it the fingerprint reader on the back. It'S not that bad, but it's a little bit smaller. It used to be a full circle. Now the smaller surface area is a bit of a bummer. There'S no wireless charging, so most phones nowadays with glass backs, are doing it to enable wireless charging, since it doesn't work through metal. Oneplus has gone with the glass back, but didn't add wireless charging, and then it's also not officially IP rated for water resistance. Oneplus kind of just says like it's: okay, if you splash water on it, it'll survive daily use, but they don't officially ip67 or ip68 rated. So keep that in mind, so it has a bunch of great upside. A bunch of you know great build great materials, great construction, but all those other little things that you have to weigh against that now on wireless charging, I got ta say the battery situation of the 1 plus 6 is really interesting. This is gon na sound, like I'm just defending one plus for not putting in wireless charging. Look they could have, they definitely could have put it in with this glass back and it would have been great, but I don't really miss it on this phone. The combination of this battery, it's a 3300 milliamp hour battery decent size plus the near stock Android with oxygen OS at 1080 P AMOLED display plus a Snapdragon a 45 with eight gigs of RAM, I'm getting like 6 plus hours every single day of screen on time. I'M getting a plus battery life if I don't use it that much it's like ending the day, forty percent, it's really good, and then, on top of all that you throw in there charging, which is still on this phone. It'S still the fastest 0 to 100 charging. I'Ve ever seen in a phone, it's super convenient and when you have all that it just kind of feels like I don't need wireless charging, it would be. Nice it'd be cool, but it's not a deal breaker for me and I think one plus is hoping that it's not a deal breaker for you either. So there's that, but now let's let's talk about that 1080p display oneplus - has stuck to their guns and they're going with yet again, a 1080p optic AMOLED display six point three inches from corner to corner, so it's huge and this time with a notch up at the Top it's part strategy, part sacrifice. The resolution 20 to 80 by 1080 is actually hugely beneficial for battery life. As I mentioned, it's also pretty great for performance you're not pushing nearly as many pixels, which means your GPU is not working as hard. Everything is super smooth, but also now it's not going to be as sharp as the galaxy s 9s and the pixels to excels of the world which have quad HD displays, but then again, like we saw in the pixel, quality control isn't easy and a great 1440p Panel is not cheap or easy to find so, instead of settling for an average quad HD screen to save money, this phone has what I'd say is the best-looking 1080p OLED in any phone right now it gets really bright. It'S colorful there's a couple different display modes for different color profiles with different amounts of saturation. It'S good. The best part of this display is actually the clever way. Hey oneplus has handled the notch up at the top, but now that we're getting deeper into this whole world of Android phones having notches and Android P, coming out with knotch support and developers getting onboard we're seeing less and less apps with those bugs that are cut Off by the notch, so that's just kind of where we're at. I think a lot of manufacturers here. Everyone complaining about that notch, though including oneplus, so there's plenty of that they're doing to hide it. If you really hate it, in fact, as you get around to using the oneplus 6 you'll notice, the display setting lets you hide the notch anytime. If you don't want to use, it works great with an OLED display. Those are black pixels and when you're, actually in apps, you almost never lose actual real estate in the app. Actually, you never lose real estate. In the app like back in the days of the essential phone, it would actually be cutting into the app you're using it. Doesn'T do that anymore unless you actually go into the display, menu and turn on a full screen mode and and explicitly give that app permission so by default, unlike the iPhone, it doesn't cut off YouTube videos. This is the same as the p20 Pro and other phones with notches. Now you still see everything and you can turn on full-screen mode if you're cool with the notch interrupting part of the app you're in if you're not into it. You never have to turn that on. So that's clean and oxygen OS, just as a whole, is fast and smooth as it is. It also has a pretty good amount of extra features while still staying pretty close to stock Android. There'S still the super fast facial recognition. There is the gaming mode that doesn't let notifications interrupt your gameplay there's an ambient display mode, that's new that works when you raise your phone up, but it's not always on, so I actually don't even really bother using it. Basically, it's not lacking features, so you can already know. I tend to keep my setup pretty clean, and this phone definitely lets me do that now for software updates, when you think about the longevity of the phone, this is actually one of the first of like maybe six phones to get included in the Android P beta Program alongside the pixel, so now it's not just the pixel. This is one of those phones. You can put the Android P beta on and that's a pretty good sign as far as the future of when it'll get updates being close to stock Android, it doesn't necessarily guarantee it's gon na get the same update timing as the pixel. You still probably have to get a pixel to be first in line for that, but it probably does mean it'll be better than your Samsung's and LG's many months down the road. So that's pretty good. I really like oxygen OS. Still. It'S clean nothing's too in-your-face. It has a few quirks and a few extra things like the shelf that put a lot of useful information at your fingertips but doesn't overwhelm you and you can always hide most of it. So I'm a fan pretty much. The only thing I don't like about the software here is the new gestures. I tried them for a while and they do work perfectly fine, there's no bugs or anything, and they are intuitive but they're. Just not smooth, like I'm so used to the iPhones gestures. Being extremely responsive and smooth to my touch - and you got to give Apple credit for that and oneplus swipe gestures are just not that so I'm sticking to the buttons on this phone. So really the last big question: we have that we're wondering about from the impressions. Video is the camera situation on the 1 plus 6. Well, if you saw the last video, you saw the blind test. You probably already have some thoughts about it from me. It'S like a b-plus as camera quality and smartphone, but that's because the a-plus smartphones, the the pixel twos of the world and the iPhone 10 and the Galaxy S nine are way up there. Those are the eight $ 900,000 flagships, so this is a B as far as cameras, but it's an A for the price. It is definitely better than other $ 500 phones. This guy is a 16 megapixel primary camera with optical stabilization and an F 1.7 aperture, and it takes pretty nice shots. I'Ve been shooting with it pretty confidently for a while focus is fine overall there's plenty of detail and not a lot of noise and pretty accurate colors if anything it biases, maybe a little towards overexposing more often than under, but dynamic range is good enough. That that hasn't been a problem and every photo is plenty saturated. So overall I'd say: I'm pretty satisfied with the photos from the 1 plus 6 camera, I'm not blown away or anything. I'M not super excited to use it, but satisfied. That'S second camera. We were wondering about it's, not a telephoto. Camera is just another 20 megapixel sensor with no OIS. It'S basically used for depth information for portrait mode. As far as we can tell which is okay, I guess it's decent. It'S not great! I'M not gon na go out of my way to use it that much, but basically the idea is, it doesn't take photos that are quite at the level of the highest end flagships, but those flagships are so much more expensive. This definitely beats any other $ 500 phone. In fact, that's really the theme for this whole one plus 6, if you've noticed the whole review, it's either knocking at the door of those flagship, smartphones or it's like one small step behind, but that is definitely beating any other 5 $ 600 Android phone. The specs are ridiculous: Snapdragon, 805, 6 or 8 gigs of ram. I have 128 gigs of storage, a 16 megapixel camera 3300 milliamp hour battery. That'S knocking out the door of like the highest-end flagships. We have right now definitely better than any other 500 ollar phone. It'S your glass and metal build it's your quality construction, great buttons. It might be missing wireless charging and a good speaker and IP certification, but it has dual SIM. It has a headphone jack. It has USB see really fast charging great battery life. Huge AMOLED display. Definitely better than other five 600 other phone. The camera, like we said, is B, maybe, but that's like we said way better than any other six-hundred allah fund, which makes it feel like a plus for the price. This is both literally and figuratively. The most polished phone one-plus has ever made, I think the choices they made really of what to keep versus what to cut out balanced out to a quality phone. It would have been so easy to review this phone like a $ 900 flagship and just bash it for like not having wireless charging or not having an A camera, but they did a really good job and it's a great phone for the money, a plus for The price that's been it. Let me know what you think, thanks for watching talk to guys the next one peace """
TQG7m1BFeRc,Huawei P20 Pro Review: The Triple Camera Smartphone!,13:15,"Hey what does if cuz mkbhd here so nowadays, it seems like it's never quite enough to just nail all the pillars of a great smartphone and put it out. It seems like. Not only do you have to do all of that, but you have to take one of them and push it to the absolute extreme, the maximum, and so this is what it looks like when you nail all the pillars, have a great smartphone and then take one Of them and take it to the next level, this is the Huawei P 20 Pro. So this is one of those phones. You'Ve either heard a lot about recently or never heard of definitely two camps with this one. This is not coming to the US and usually that stops me from even trying a phone in the first place, because I know I can't recommend it for a lot of people, but this caught my attention, obviously like Huawei phones in general, have just been getting my Attention more and more lately, but this one just captured it completely: it's crazy new color, triple cameras on the back 4000 milliamp hour battery a hundred and nine score on DxO mark. So I picked it up. I used it. Here'S my thoughts so on the outside aesthetics wise. I do like this phone a lot. It has a couple flaws. It'S not perfect, but it's one of the few really unique. Looking phones out there, of course, mainly because of this back this gradient color, I mean it's a crazy, looking awesome back of the phone it blends from like this aqua green to blue to purple and in different amounts, depending on where you look at it from it, Looks different in everyone's video, I'm kind of trying to do my best with the camera I have, but there's other colors of the p20 and p20 Pro I wouldn't even consider them. This is definitely the coolest looking one. It'S called Twilight. It'S just weird that there's a lot of text on the back of the phone. I would think it would look way cleaner. If all that wasn't here, it might even look sick with, like a logo toss on there, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. This just is what it is: it's a super, unique colorful and also fingerprint and dust magnet phone. I got your power button and your volume rocker on the same side. I know that doesn't count as a colored power button Huawei and I have a little bar there, but you have to have the whole button with some color good. Try, though, but the rest of this body is prime, it's what you'd expect from a high-end 20-18 flagship which it is so metal rails, curved edges, its ip67 water-resistant, which is always nice. It'S definitely not too thin. You know feel solid in the hand nice weight yeah, an IR blaster which not every phone does now, but also no expandable storage and no headphone jack. This camera bump is also mildly annoying to me, because it sticks out enough from the phone that it will rock on a table. I just I got to point that out. Not all phones have that problem, but it's not a deal-breaker eat it, but really design-wise. My biggest question mark is on the front of this phone, so it has a notch. So when notch is what you do in a phone in 2018, when you want to get rid of all the bezels, but you don't quite have the technology to fully do so. So you know the front facing speaker: the selfie camera you got to keep them just make a little cutout around them. Fine, I get it, but this phone also has a finger for reader on the front and then a huge, empty chin bezel with nothing else in it, no buttons just a bezel like you're, either trying to get rid of the bezel or you're. Not it's weird that they would put a notch like they're, trying to go totally bezel this, but then also have a chin kind of make up your mind there I feel, like you, could have made this look way better with an even top and bottom bezel. There'S even an option in the software to do exactly that, and it doesn't look that bad but yeah the fingerprint reader is on the front. It'S still super fast. I don't mind it being here. Why wait does that, maybe better than anyone still, and it also acts as a gesture pad if you want to disable the on-screen buttons and get some extra screen real estate back? You can do that to your call, but above it all, is that pretty nice 6.1 inch OLED display, with, of course, that notch that we talked about it's a 20 to 40 by 1080 panel. So it's a 18 point. 7 by 9 aspect ratio slightly taller than the normal tall, but the OLED panel itself is pretty good. It gets bright enough to see outdoors with no problem. There'S no shift issues, it's just not quite to the greatness level of like a Samsung phone. It'S not quite as bright or as vibrant, but it's right in line with what you'd expect from a flagship, oh and then it also packs in a four thousand milliamp hour battery in a phone. That'S not that thick! So that's pretty great! This has been consistently five plus hours of screen on time, which, for my use, is excellent. So there's no problem with battery here and I've been preaching like if you want to make a phone make it as thick as you want. No one really wants the phone to be that razor, thin and adding a couple extra millimeters for a sizable battery is a great choice. I mean look at that. This phone is definitely not thick at all. Bravo to huawei definitely keep doing that. So for the hardware look, it's it's all pretty! Damn good the specs inside pretty good! You know we're looking at six eggs, Aram 128 gigs of storage, the chipset is all right. We definitely have better things out here with Qualcomm, but it's still good enough and the experience of using this phone again it'll come down to what you do with Android. I won't talk too long about emui, but those of you familiar with Huawei know that this is their skin on top of Android. Here, with this one, it's emui 8.1, based on top of Android 8.1. So using it everyday, I gave it a shot again and it the more I use it. The more it kind of reminds me of what Samsung felt like a couple years ago worth they're, just basically throwing as many features as possible at you, because really there are a lot of features in here, whether you use them all or not. You know there's backup and restore features. There'S big screen features. Multitasking features, there's multiple Power Save modes with different intensities. You can adjust the screen resolution, which is in battery settings for some reason. Instead of display settings, there's even a smart screen, shot feature that won't stop interrupting me, even though I've turned it off. It still randomly thinks some of my swipes and knocks our screen shot attempts and starts doing the magic animation. Please stop doing that. Overall, you can fix or not use pretty much any of the things you don't like, except for the visual changes. I'Ve been using it with Nova Launcher, as you can tell, but yeah they're still gon na have Huawei's icons and Huawei's quick settings and their multitasking UI, and all that and also you're gon na be waiting for a couple apps like Instagram, for example, to play nice With that knotch Android P, when it gets released, is supposed to help a lot with that, but for now there's definitely some bugs, but alright. Alright, I'm sure you knew when you saw this phone came out with a 40 megapixel main camera. You knew it would grab. My attention, you know why, I'm here you knew when you put out a phone with not one not two but three cameras on the back, that it would turn my head. You don't wan na hear and you knew when this thing got a DxO mark score of a hundred and nine that I just couldn't resist, picking it up and actually seeing what it's all about. So, let's take a deep look at why I was even interested in this phone in the first place, the cameras. So yes, the Huawei p20 Pro has three cameras on the back. The main sensor is a 40 megapixel sensor with optical stabilization and an F 1.8 aperture. The secondary is a 20 megapixel monochrome sensor, also with optical image, stabilization and an F 1.6 aperture, and the third is an 8 megapixel, 3x telephoto lens again stabilized this time. F. 2.4! So that's a lot of numbers. The 14 megapixel sensor is huge and I don't just mean like the megapixel count is huge. I mean the actual physical size of the sensor. It'S a 1 over 1 point, 7 inch sensor, diagonally, that's about twice the size of the galaxy s 9 and the pixel 2. In the iPhone 10 sensors. That'S half an inch diagonally damn. There are a lot of potential advantages to a physically larger sensor. I use in my main, shooting a camera with a massive sensor. You get better low-light sensitivity, bigger pixels, better overall performance, less gain a wider field of view, so I love the concept. I love the idea of putting a big sensor in a smart phone camera so how'd. It turn out well right off the bat. The photos look pretty good. Not only is it a big sensor, it is a good sensor, so you get accurate colors. A nice dynamic range plenty of detail and that's really the main characteristic you're gon na notice about the p20 pro photos, lots of detail thanks to the sensor and the sharpening being aggressive as hell and then a shallow ish depth of field. Thanks to the sensor size and the fixed wide aperture, but here's some notes for you to consider about these cameras besides just pointing and shooting in auto mode, so number one. The main camera uses a quad of bayer structure when taking photos, which means it's a 40 megapixel sensor, but it's outputting data bend in 2 by 2 blocks of pixels, so you're getting an output image of 10 mega images. Still super sharp and detailed, but ten megapixel photos number two: the video mode is really not that great, some might say trash like it can shoot stabilized 1080p video with decent color and detail, but because of the chip its using it can't keep up with the stabilization Of 4k, the 4k video really looks bad off of this phone. Sadly, I wish it was as completely the video camera as it was a photo camera, but it's not but number three. This whole camera is just fast. The whole experience of taking photos of it is fast which I love it has laser autofocus. It'S super quick, the time to open the camera and actually grab a shot is super snappy and you can even double press volume down to take a snapshot of what you're pointing at in like 0.3 seconds. But then you don't really know like what you're taking a picture of. So that's, maybe a little extreme. But the point is it's fast. Once you're in the app you hit the telephoto zoom button, you get 3x or 5x with a single touch. It all works. For me and then a I okay, I there's a lot of people keep asking about the AI all over this phone, but especially in the camera about you know why? Don'T people give it enough credit in the videos it's a big deal and makes better than others I'll tell you exactly why I've used it. It'S pretty straightforward. Basically, there's a trigger to turn on AI and the camera so on by default and when it's on, if you give it a second in the viewfinder, it tries to identify everything you take a photo of and then automatically enhance some predetermined things. It thinks you'll like about that photo and it's right about identifying what you're trying to take a photo of more often than not like you take a photo of the sky. It puts it in blue sky mode. Take a picture of greenery puts it in greenery mode, flower mode, pet mode, everything it just. It knows pretty much instantly, but then it's the improvements that it decides to make once it knows what you're taking a photo of that are pretty basic like in greenery mode. For example, if you're taking a photo of a plant - and it has green in it - it turns on green remote and it just basically blasts the green Channel in the plants and makes it look more green cool in blue sky mode. It does the same thing if you point it at like a sky line and there's blue in the sky. It knows it's blue sky and it just blasts. The blue Channel makes the sky really blue. Like I cool, that's I'm glad it worked, but maybe I don't even want that to be more blue. I just want a picture of what I'm taking a picture of. I don't know, maybe I'm not the normal smartphone photo taker, but I don't want automatic enhancement. Has never been my thing, I I turned it off pretty quick. I usually just want to take a photo straight from the sensor, which looks pretty good and maybe use that AI later for, like sorting through my photos or making them easier to find but yeah a lot of the p20 pros photos. You know they don't need any editing or enhancing, because they look great straight off the sensor. I mean I'm talking effortless shallow depth-of-field, a plus detail, like I said from all those megapixels. I just wish the processing wasn't so aggressive. Sometimes it looks a little too sharp. Such a big sensor should also have a great advantage in low-light, but when you compare it to smaller censored, cameras like I did. The low-light photos are cleaner, yes, but they also have a ton of smoothing and noise reduction, because the processing is so aggressive. It almost feels like the software is holding back the hardware. So what I'm comparing like these two and I'm after the absolute best smartphone camera, the pixel - is taking often much better photos more consistently because of the software I mean. There'S definitely still things p20 Pro can do that pixel can't, especially with that 3x telephoto zoom. That can be really great, but if what you're after is the best overall smartphone photos, the answer is still pixel and I think anyone who shot with both of these would agree. So, at the end of the day, p20 pro is my favorite Huawei phone. Yet obviously, no doubt it's kind of a bummer that is not coming to the u.s.. It would be cool to see I'm still a fan of a lot of the choices they've made here. Design wise build quality, wise and I got to say even emui - is better than it's ever been, but it's not quite enough to convince me to switch to it full-time if the camera and the software and the build are the biggest draws to this phone. It'S definitely gon na have the build beat. I mean this is a one-of-a-kind like back of a phone for sure, but if the camera and software are both better on another phone, it's remarkable how many times I keep going back to pixel, but for now I'll give p20 pro like a 45-degree thumbs up pretty Good, not bad, I'm a fan of the decisions, I'm looking forward to p30 till the next one, thanks for watching doc, see guys later peace, """
Gzy_nCkn88U,Samsung Galaxy S9 Review: The Perfect... Samsung!,12:06,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm THD here, and this may all look very familiar to you. This is Samsung Galaxy S. 9 yeah. This is definitely s 9, and this is new you're, probably wondering if it's worth your money for an upgrade. You may also just be wondering if it's a good phone or not, so I think the best way to describe this phone is it's a nearly perfect Samsung phone. So what I mean by that is, if you've liked Samsung phones in the past, or you have an old Samsung phone and you like what they do with the software, with the great cameras with the awesome design with their build, then this is the best and most Complete version of that that they've ever made, but, conversely, if you already don't like Samsung phones like if slow, Android updates, aren't your thing or you just don't like what they do with the skin, then this isn't going to change your mind. So it's a nearly perfect Samsung phone. So last year the Galaxy s8 had the infinity display this year again galaxy s 9 has one of the absolute best displays in any smartphone sandwiched between even slightly thinner top and bottom bezels and last time and they've even done a slightly better job, hiding the sensors And things in that top bezel, so the black looks more seamless and that your piece also now doubles as a second speaker, front-facing speakers. So you kind of have a bit of a stereo speaker thing going on here. It'S not quite the same. Obviously, as two big dedicated front-facing speakers, but at least now it's a bit louder and clearer. If you accidentally block the bottom speaker which can happen, you don't completely miss. What'S going on so it's better! Last year you also had USBC and wireless charging fast charging. All that that is also all still here USB see fast charging wireless charging, a headphone jack water resistance is great clicky buttons and just overall a plus build quality. Now it's still glass, which means you're still gon na get smudges. So if you want to pick up a D brand skin, this new black camo might not make your phone invisible, but it'll make all the smudges and scratches disappear, and then the biggest change on the outside has to be obviously the fingerprint reader placement. It'S now in the middle instead of up at the top next to the camera, and that makes a huge difference even more than people are giving it credit for it's perfect. Now it's raised slightly. So it's easy to know when your fingers on it when you're not looking at it and registering your fingerprint, is now just a slow swipe. Like you roll your finger down the scanner once, which is actually really cool, I thought it was a glitch. Usually you kind of you know: you have to press it on the fingerprint reader a whole bunch of times to enroll your finger, but during this phone setup you just roll your finger down at once and it's a hundred percent done. That is awesome and then there's also now on the back of this phone, a blood pressure sensor in addition to the heart rate monitor so the heart rate monitor, is not new. We'Ve had that for a while, you can measure your heart rate, that's quick, but the blood pressure sensor. Usually you haven't been able to do that with anything other than like the rap and the tools in the doctor's office to actually get that reading. In that number, I wasn't able to get that reading with s health or any of the health apps on my phone, but I like a really good video from Dave 2d on how exactly this works. There'S a certain way to get it to help you. If you do want to use this phone to measure blood pressure, but as of right now, it's just a pretty cool new addition. Last year's galaxy s 8 also had top notch specs. When it came out s 9 here keeps that up and bumps it up to again for 2018 snapdragon, 845 and four or six gigs of ram, and this does definitely feel like the smoothest Samsung phone. Yet it still doesn't match stock Android. You know there's still little performance hiccups like when opening up Bixby, for example, and occasionally in some other samsung apps, but in my a couple of weeks with this phone. That'S about it. Everything else nearly matches pixel to and smoothness, and I'm really happy about that. And then there is all the Samsung software again they're still really not shy about their colourful look on top of Android. So it's not gon na change your mind if you already dislike the Samsung stuff, but it's all better, it still has a ton of advanced features. It added iris scanning from the note, which is a little slower but more secure than regular facial recognition using a front-facing camera and there's also a new intelligent scan which combines face scanning and iris scanning, basically using which one works better, depending on light conditions. So I'm really into the new fingerprint reader, so I haven't necessarily used these as much, but it's cool to have all the options. It still has a bunch of Samsung's and big green tricks and app shortcuts. You still get the edge shortcuts and some more customization options with those sometimes with all the stuff that can feel like Samsung is just kind of dumping as many features as possible on you, and maybe they are hurt, but that's part of what they do. It still has Bixby and the Bixby button and everything Bixby is good for okay. I could have just disabled the Bixby button from day one. I know that, but I decided to give it another chance. I'Ve left it enabled since day, one every day using Bixby, and it's still not that great, not only have I triggered it a couple times on purpose, but many times by accident when taking it out of my pocket and every time I open it. I just kind of scroll down hoping to find something useful in these cards, but usually I don't so then I close it Bixby voice can still do a lot of those like really intricate digging into the settings and longer strings of commands and the phone that other Assistants can't do as well, so that's pretty cool, so I turn on the flashlight. So if you're into that, if that's something you do on your phone, often you'll like Bixby when it understands you, but I'm not that person, so I'm gon na go ahead and disable it for now so yeah. This is clearly still unapologetically a Samsung phone in a software department for better or for worse, there's, still, two browsers out the box. Two smart assistants, two calendars, two messaging apps, all the classic half-hearted Samsung ecosystem push is still there, but it's also Android. So you can get rid of that stuff. That'S annoying! If you don't want it battery life, I think, is the biggest weakness of these new phones, the s9 and s9 plus it's not terrible, but among all the other great things about these phones, the battery life is definitely not great. So I spend most my time with the s9 Plus, which has the bigger screen, but also bigger battery thirty five hundred million powers, and it would be dead by the end of the day and most of my heavy use days with a lot of navigation. A lot of music playing a lot of screen on time, watching videos and social media. That would be enough to kill this phone in a single day. I don't even do that much mobile gaming, but if I worth that would kill it too. The upside of that, as it always is with Samsung, is fast charging and wireless charging. It charges really fast with the right charger, the one in the box of course, or one of several other USBC chargers like the MacBook Pro charger, but can be kind of picky. The charger, for example, didn't work if you're curious, but being able to top up really quickly during the day. For me, I've said this before it does offset the slightly weak battery this phone has. It would be great if it had better battery, but for me that's good enough depends on who you are and then for the biggest most reimagined new change in these phones. That would be the camera. Let'S break that down. So there's a new 12 megapixel camera on the back and if you get the s 9 plus it gets the second telephoto camera as well, and it's the first modern smartphone with a variable aperture camera. It can physically switch between F, 1.5 and F 2.4. Depending on your lighting, so it defaults to F 2.4, which is roughly average for a smartphone camera actually, and that's for your Sharp normal daylight photos. Most of the time when you do get to low-light under 100 Lux. That'S when it's gon na switch to wide-open F. 1.5, technically speaking, the mechanism to do this is really impressive, but it only matters if you can see the difference in photos, so does it make a difference so alright, generally photos from the galaxy s 9. Camera are pretty damn good photos are a little bit less over-processed and a little less over sharpened than they used to be, but it's clearly still the Samsung look. We'Re used to with the bright vibrant, colors, dynamic range I'd say, is the most noticeable improvement, but that's something they've actively worked on, so it's good to see something you'll notice looking through all of these, though, is Samsung's tendency to overexpose still pretty much every photo. I take on the galaxy s 9 in Auto mode is just a little bit too bright. It'S just just a little bit, but then it can also be a sort of an advantage when you take it to low-light galaxy s. 9 low-light photos look pretty good, and that really is thanks to the F 1.5 aperture, letting in way more light. So the question of is this variable aperture, making a difference. Well, low-light shots have seen a real bump up, there's less smoothing because it gets rid of less grain because there's less grain because there's more light being let into the camera. So fundamentally, yes, it's working. It'S still not the best camera in any smartphone, though that's still pixel hands down and I'd say it still falls a little bit behind iPhone 10, but I don't think anyone will be disappointed with the third-placed performance of a great galaxy s camera. Something people have also noticed recently. Is it shoots video in the REC 2020 color space instead of rec 709? That'S what happens when you turn on or leave on HDR. If you turn that off, they can be rec 709. So it's trying to look better again and more saturated on the Samsung displays, but you can turn that off. So all right back in the impressions video I did mention that seems like Galaxy S. 9 plus will have a pretty big advantage over the regular Galaxy S. Nine because you're getting now more RAM, more screen, more battery and more cameras, so it turns out most of this isn't actually that big of a deal in the more RAM Department - yes, Galaxy S, nine plus, has six gigs of RAM, while the regular s9 has four Gigs Ram both are plenty hardly ever gon na notice the difference in regular everyday use. It could be nice for future proofing now. The s9 plus obviously has the second telephoto camera for live focus and for optical zoom, sometimes may or may not every use that if you do obviously go that's 9 plus, but you might not miss that and then, of course, the size difference means your 5.8 inch Display versus 6.2 inch and then your 3,000 to 3,500 milliamp hour battery again, both of which are somewhat mediocre, so not a huge difference between them. So it's a toss-up if you're choosing between them, but I think the biggest thing I got out of this galaxy s. 9 plus existing now at this price point is: there is way less reason to buy a Galaxy Note. 8 right now. The note 8 is really all about the stylus and comes in at about a thousand bucks. I would definitely pick the s9 plus over that because of the lower price, even though you get a slightly smaller screen. All the same advantages are there. If you don't use that stylus and even a lot of the other reasons, people might have gone towards the Galaxy. Note in the past, like your media experience the huge screen, this tends to do a lot of that just as good, if not better, since you also get stereo speakers, but that's just if you're picking between Samsung phones. My point from the beginning of the video stands: this is just about the optimal Samsung phone that you can get right now, with all the pros and cons that come with that get all the pros and upsides of the Samsung experience taken to the max. The awesome displays the A build quality, the checking of pretty much every box, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage and a pretty damn good camera. But you also get all the cons of the Samsung experience to your double apps you're, slower, Android updates your occasional hiccups bixby. So this thing really is great: it's perfect for the Samsung lover, but I, as you probably already know, am NOT that person. I will be switching back. I think, to my pixel two as a daily. So, with the Galaxy S nine, it makes it really easy to under appreciated because it seems like you know. Oh it's just a minor upgrade. It'S not that much better! It'S like an sas and you could say it's a jack-of-all-trades but the master of none. But that's actually what makes this phone so good. First of all, it is the master of one the display there isn't really any better than this, but it's actually so good at so many different things and bad at so few things, especially being so good at the hardware suite. That'S what makes this phone so easy to recommend, and so I do. I recommend the Galaxy S. 9. It'S really good! So either way, that's been it thanks for watching talk to you guys in the next one peace """
jn9mHzXJIV0,18-core iMac Pro Review: Not a Trap!,10:52,"So this is the iMac Pro it's Apple's. First true Pro desktop workstation in years, and it's pretty damn good. So I made my first impressions, video of the new iMac Pro using somewhere. What I'd call like a mid tier iMac pros the 10 core. The total price ran around 10 grand for that machine. The a Mac Pro starts at about 5,000 bucks on launch day, though I did order what would be the highest end available, iMac pro spec config, with the intention of making it my full daily driver, I'm gon na give it a shot and replace the Mac Pro. So that's what this is turns out to be the 18 core Xeon CPU 128 gigs of ram the 16 gig Vegas 64 and a 4 terabyte SSD, and all that runs around 13,000 bucks, and I have actually really liked it. So, a couple months ago I was wondering if I Mac Pro was a trap. I was thinking I would try it, and it would just be my interim machine until that fully modular and new Mac Pro comes out maybe this year, and that may still be true. But after using this, I can really say that I can highly recommend iMac pro - maybe not this 18 core one, but this is one my favorite and new Apple products in a really long time. So, of course, anyone considering buying one will want to know. Why should I get an iMac Pro over a regular high-end iMac? You know you can get a maxed out 5k iMac with a core i7 64 gigs of ram all of that for about 5 grand. So why pay more for this? So this is everything that's different about this deceivingly different beast, the iMac pro, so the outside dimensions are exactly the same as a normal iMac, which means same 5k display, but also same big bezels and same huge chin and same non adjustable stand. So you know part of the reason I was looking forward to the new Mac Pro is because I've never really been a huge fan of the way the iMac looks. I'D rather use my own monitor. I actually prefer dual monitors and a matte finish, but that's not to say this 5k display here is bad. In fact, it's excellent, it's one of the best and it always has been, but here's what is new number one, the space gray. Obviously I think it's hot. I would love an even more like matte black undertone, but I know we're not getting that so for now. I can't appreciate the space gray paint the space grey keyboard, the black buttons, the trackpad, the black, lightning, cable, black Apple stickers, even all the stuff that you can only get with an iMac pro. It doesn't save the Magic Mouse from dumb design, but you know at least now it's better-looking so number two. The built-in speakers of the iMac Pro are actually significantly louder and fuller and better than a regular iMac. Now you may or may not care about that. If you're a pro user, you probably don't use the built-in speakers, obviously don't. I use an audio device to my external speakers and I also have this little Satechi little hub here that plugs and gets my ports around the front and goes right into the speaker. But if you do use the built-in speakers, that's a nice bonus and speaking of ports. Of course, number three is those ports, so the iMac Pro has a 20-18 workstation suite of high performance. Io has four full-size USB 3.0 ports, four Thunderbolt 3 USB C ports, an SD card reader, a headphone jack and tend to give an Ethernet, which is pretty huge for networking professionals right there, I'm currently using most of these ports on mine. So for my external storage, the Pegasus, the audio device, the red mag reader - things like that, but I have a couple left over. So I haven't found that I need more ports. But if I added another 5k monitor, which you can do, that would fill my Thunderbolt 3 ports, but so far I'm alright. Now again, it is an all-in-one, but technically it's an all-in-one desktop and for any desktop I got ta say I usually want the port's to be pretty easily within reach. So that's yet another reason why I'd prefer a Mac Pro but I'll link to this little Satechi hope. I got right below that like button. If you want more info on it and I'll also link the 12 South Stand, I have mine on as well. I'Ve talked about them before in my setup, tour video, but there's that so number four is the built-in webcam. So it's now rocking this 1080p FaceTime camera, which you know this is also better than a normal iMac. But it's not that great. I mean we still have these incredible cameras. These 4k optically stabilized cameras in this little device here, but in this entire bezel of this whole iMac purim looking at this is the best they could fit. Apparently not a big deal so number five is the vents and the cooling. This is pretty minor, but I Mac Pro is dead silent even with a heavy edit going on in Final Cut Pro or a massive amount of multitasking. It seems like apples pretty into keeping the fan speed low on this thing. I'Ve heard it speed up, maybe twice ever while using it and both of those times is word during rendering and final cut. So the slot at the bottom is air intake and the vents at the top near the stand or where the hot air is blowing out. Some people have definitely mentioned that. It seems like the angle of the IMAX stand, would take the hot air output and bounce it back into the cool air vent, but I've never found that the fan spins fast enough to move the hot air out that fast, so it just kind of hot air. Just kind of Rises and the cold air intake takes in whatever is at your desk level, and that brings us to number six, the one that really matters the internals like I mentioned this is a maxed out iMac Pro here. So this is the 18 cores E """
mpjREfvZiDs,Apple HomePod Review: The Dumbest Smart Speaker?,9:41,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm kitty HD here and in this box, is one of the least anticipated new Apple products. In a long time it was announced back in June of 2017, and it's been a couple months. It got delayed now it's February of the next year 2018 and it's finally shipping and it's in our hands. It'S the home pod and now that it's here, let's see what it's all about: [ Applause ]. So this is Apple's entry into the sort of a newish smart speaker market, it's pretty late, obviously, but this is what they've come up with it's a 350 dollar tissue box sized mesh cylinder that actually has some really excellent hardware. So setting it up is pretty simple: it has that w1 chip inside, so you just get your iPhone somewhere near it, and it shows up on your screen. You name what room it's in and then you set it up in about a minute like the air. Potts did so that's definitely the Apple advantage for easy, pairing and setup of an accessory. The weird thing is, it didn't add it to my iMac or other computers. As a speaker, I kind of wish, I could have tried to use the home pod as a speaker for my iMac, but you can't oh well classic Apple, but the hardware is clean and super Apple II, especially this white one. It'S just this fabric bulb that sits in your living room or on a table or wherever you decide to put it a little screen up in the circle at the top, and all that has is your volume controls and a little Siri indicator that lights up when You'Re using it, the cable as you've probably seen, is built in it's technically removable with like a lot of effort, so it's pretty clear Apple doesn't want you doing that, that's more for like a technician working on it after the fact, but most other speakers have removable Cables, so that's kind of interesting. This one is a high quality sleeved cable though so I'm not mad, and if you ever pick up and hold a home pod because of the 3d fabric, it's kind of squishy just a little. I don't know why it ever pick up a speaker, but it's true, the one weird thing that, with this hardware, is it kind of has this seam on it. It'S not easy to see, but you can kind of make it out it's on a different place. On my two different home pods, so I honestly have no idea why it's there, you would think they would always put that seam on the back by the cord. Instead of on the side, maybe I'm just being picky. I don't know I've seen some tear downs, but I'm sure Jerry rigged. Everything we'll have an answer for us soon enough on why that seam is there, but once it's set up there's a lot of talk about the things home pod can do versus what it can't do. It'S supposed to be a smart speaker, and I say it's supposed to be - and I put it in air quotes because there's a lot of things that when you compare it to Google home or Amazon Alexa, it just doesn't do but the things it does do it Does really well and really quickly, so the inside of the pod is a little different. It'S seven tweeters all facing out from the middle and one woofer at the top firing upwards. So, in theory, is creating this sort of at 360 degrees sound that you can hear the same from any direction around the home pod and then it also does this bit of analysis using six built-in microphones to figure out how close it is to things around. Like a wall or an open space, it analyzes that space and then it adjusts the levels to sound best from every angle. No matter where you are so it's kind of like this smart, sound analysis, mostly to not overwhelm me with base, but the home pod isn't overly bass heavy in the first place. It'S super balanced. It does great instrument. Separation and honestly, it overall sounds excellent, especially for the size. It'S only a little bigger than a normal Google home, which I think a lot of people forget about it's really small, but it gets really loud. I'Ve listened to a lot of different music on these different smart speakers lately, and this is in fact the best sounding one. Some people have debated about it versus Google, home max the home max gets louder for sure at a hundred percent volume. It'S almost too loud, but it also distorts a lot at that volume and the bass is overwhelming, so you pretty much have to go outside to enjoy it. That loud home pod does not get as loud, but at a hundred percent volume it sounds really really good and again, its unique being that sort of a circular, 360-degree sound and most people put a speaker. That'S pretty directional near a wall or a corner anyway, but you kind of get an extra bit of confidence. If you can put this on a table or anywhere in a room and it'll sound, just as good, hey, Siri play alta sure here's a personalized station abouta. So the array of microphones listening for your voice is excellent. It can hear you pretty much all the time from across the room when music is playing loud. It'S been great at that, but again what it comes down to is what home pod can do and what home pod can't do. It can play music through Apple music, so you can ask Siri to play a song or playlist or play the radio and, if you're, an Apple music subscriber it's hooked up to your iPhone and it'll work. But let's say you're one of the 70 million people who uses Spotify and not Apple music. Yes, technically it can work kinda. You can airplay from Spotify to a home pod, but then your voice controls don't work as well. You can't ask first certain song or certain playlists: you can go forward and backwards in your tracklist, but that's about it. It'S not ideal but from their home pod can do pretty much anything Siri does. So if you want to ask it questions like who is this person, how tall is this person, some weather, trivia, some spelling, your classic things like that it can handle that you can also set reminders. So if you ask it to take out the garbage at three o'clock, it'll do that and it'll set a reminder in your reminders. App on your iPhone, hey, Siri who's. James Harden James Harden currently plays shooting guard for the Rockets, hey Siri. How tall is he James Harden is 6 feet, 5 inches tall, hey Siri, what's the weather in Honolulu tomorrow the forecast is calling for thunderstorms in Honolulu Hawaii. Tomorrow the high will be 78 degrees and the low will be 66. It can also read your last text message out loud or send a text and we'll get to that in a second, but it also can turn on and off homekit enabled lights. It can connect to Evernote it's about it, but here's what it can't do so for all the great microphones that are in home pod. It can hear my voice from across the room. It can't distinguish my voice from your voice. So if you have a home, podding you've been watching this video I've probably triggered yours multiple times, because it thinks we're all one voice. So that means anyone who's in the room with you and your home pod can ask it to read your texts out loud or send a text message for you, because it thinks it's you, so if you're not into that, you definitely want to uncheck. This show personal info tab either during the setup or after the setup. You can change it, but that's just a weird quirk about home pod. You would think with mics, so good and with Apple software, so good. It should be able to tell our voices apart home. Pod also cannot ever connect to anything, that's not an iPhone. It can't be used as a Bluetooth, speaker and there's no audio jack, so you can't plug anything in to use its audio quality for anything other than an iPhone. You also cannot set Spotify as your default music player anytime. You ask it to play something in value. Your voice, it will have to be Apple music. You cannot connect two of them together as a stereo pair. Yet that's apparently I've heard coming in a software update, but as of right now you can connect to Google home maxes together, as a stereo pair doesn't happen with home pod. Yet you can't order products online, you can't or food online. You can't call an uber or a lift with it. You can't have it read, calendar events or set any calendar events. You can't set multiple timers at the same time, only one at a time which seems like something you would do in a kitchen with a smart speaker. You can't have it make phone calls by your voice. Again, that's something you have to setup on your phone and then airplay to the home pod. You can't look up a recipe you can't use Find My Phone. The list goes on and on there's so many things at home pod when you compare it to other smart speakers. Just doesn't do so. In conclusion, home pod is a weird product. It'S three or forty, nine bucks right now, which means you can compare it to other smart speakers like Google, home or Amazon Alexa or some other dedicated speaker systems like Sonos. It sounds better than any other Bluetooth speaker. It sounds better than the other smart speakers and honestly, it sounds better than a lot of the dedicated sound systems like Asano's the audio engineering that went into this thing, the clarity, the instrument separation, the bass response, the 360-degree sound, is next-level. The engineer should be proud of this, but in terms of smartness smartness, Siri vs., Alexa or Google home, not even close, so you've probably heard this conclusion before, but if you're in the Apple ecosystem, meaning you use an iPhone, you use Siri a lot and you're an Apple music, subscriber then this is the best sounding smart speaker that you can get, but in most cases honestly you're gon na be better off buying a much smarter speaker that can do way more. That sounds almost as good. It really feels like getting a home pod right now and using it a lot just magnifies everything, that's wrong with Siri and all serious shortcomings, so the engineering team that made it sound so good. They should totally make a separate $ 350 Apple speaker with a headphone jack that anyone can connect to and that would do well on its own competitive world. But for now, if you're in the market for a smart speaker, I'd, say shop around watch some other reviews. This isn't the first choice until then, thanks for watching talk to guys the next one tastes """
ZWuPwcwl214,Google Home Max Review: $400 Smart Speaker?,7:47,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kim PhD here - and this is Google home max it's brand new, but you might have forgotten about it since its announcement a couple of weeks ago. So let me refresh your memory on exactly what it is. So we already had. Google, home Mini this little donut size, puck speaker, this is $ 49 and then we have Google home. This is the original it's about the size of like a large coffee, mug and it's 119 bucks, and then this is Google home max this. It'S like the size of probably a watermelon right now pretty heavy too, and this will cost 399. So the design here is pretty solid inside its its dual 4.5 inch woofers behind the mesh here and then dual point: seven inch tweeters so right off the bat, the biggest advantage to home max having this cabinet. That'S so big with so much more space is dedicated drivers for dedicated frequencies. I want sideways here in landscape mode. These drivers are gon na. Give you stereo audio, which pretty much no other smart speaker does Apple home pod. Won'T even do that from what I've been told and it's a pretty simple, looking speaker it just kind of blends in you: don't really want it to be too flashy. After all, so it comes in two colors, black and white, or charcoal and chalk up there. So you got these lights in the middle of the mesh and then there really are no buttons up at the front or the sides or anything just a single touch bar at the top. You slide left and right to adjust the volume and you can touch in the middle to play. Pause simple as that, and it sits on this little magnetic circular pad that it comes with it's pretty dense and then there's some magnets in the bottom of the speaker. Right here and it just kind of slaps onto the bottom like that and that acts as an isolation pad, so it doesn't Rumble whatever surface it's on, which is pretty cool. You have that in a lot of high-end speakers that sit on bookshelves or on desktops. So it's cool that it comes with that. What'S even cooler is that if, for some reason you buy two of these, you can set them up vertically, like bookshelf speakers and they pair with each other, and each one is a channel in a stereo audio. So you can get some real separation and these little isolation pads just slap on the side now, so they can stand up and look great and now the volume control works with the correct orientation as well, and if you accidentally turn it upside down, you get a Little warning message by the way the Google home is upside down it'll work best if you turn it over, so I'm gon na do that now. The rest of the hardware, if you flip it around to the back you'll see up at the top, is meats which I mentioned. I wanted it to be a button because on the mini you could get out of sync, but now you can't meet the mics with just your voice anymore. So it's just a switch, so I guess that's less confusing and then the bottom corner. You get your headphone jack to plug in an external audio source like a record player or whatever else you got going on a USB C port nice. I don't know what I'd use it for exactly but nice I plugged my phone in it charged, which is cool, but that's about it, and then you have the power cable, the cable itself on the white one is like this: olive off white greenish color, not sure Why but what I do like about it is a small end to it, meaning the power circuits are all on the speaker itself, so it leaves room for other stuff at your outlet, unlike the other two Google homes. But let's get to the meat of this, which is how does it sound? It is a four hundred dollar premium, smart speaker, so it better sound great. So how does it sound? It sounds great. It gets ridiculously loud. The speakers are twenty times more powerful than these. Google home speakers, which is nuts when you're talking to the assistant, it literally sounds like there's another person in the room with you. It'S kind of trippy, hey, Google. How tall are you it could get pretty tall since I'm software? That might be the only way to find out. You really get all the benefits of a dedicated drivers, though, when you just listen to music at full blast, it's stupid loud, obviously, and unless they're playing music for a party, you'll probably never use it this loud, and it does distort a bit at this volume. But at seventy seventy five percent volume it sounds great and is still pretty damn loud. The original Google home sounded alright, but I guess let's attempt an audio comparison. [ Applause ]. It has a lot of rich punchy bass and a nice clarity to everything across the board. It is exaggerated, like don't get me wrong. It is a v-shaped equalizer, because it's not a reference monitor it's it's a speaker design for listening. It'S trying to color it up and make it sound fun, so the bass is still really punchy and impressive, and that's also where these microphones come in. First of all, it needs those mics to hear you say commands from like 20-plus feet away over the music. It'S already playing pretty loud and it does a pretty good job at that, but it also uses those mics for what's called smart, sound see when speakers get big enough, they can produce frequencies so low that they literally bounce off the walls in the room. You'Re in, like I'm sure, you've been in a room where the sound just resonates everywhere and it overpowers everything else. This is supposed to eliminate that it uses the microphones to measure the acoustics of the room. It'S in figure out how close the nearest wall is. So it's not overpowering you with bass and then makes its adjustments accordingly, it doesn't seem to make a drastic difference to me in the way it sounds like it sounds good anyway, but the idea is really smart. It'S machine learning and the speaker definitely likes to be in the corner of a room in the first place. It'S not an omnidirectional speaker like the home mini or, like a 360 degree sound. All the audio is going in one direction, so you tend to put it near a wall or somewhere in a corner and then let it fill the room from there and you can also control the sound via the app. So if you want to add more or less basing or already getting, you can do that pretty easily. So that's what you're getting it's a kind of hyper smart premium, speaker you're, just dragging in the best of both worlds. Most smart speakers like Alexa and the other Google homes, don't have the really really nice rich high quality, sound and stereo speakers, but most high-quality speaker systems. Don'T have the machine learning and the Google assistant built-in and less. You could grab a chromecast Audio 35 bucks plug it into some existing nice speakers and then get Google home mini 49 bucks and set the default audio output of the Google home to be that chromecast Audio. So it's always using those speakers boom. Now you have your smart speakers. I really do like this thing now. I'M not gon na lie like I already liked the original Google home this thing does all the exact same stuff. The Google home does but sounds a million times better. Just makes me more likely to use it more likely, listen to music on it. Things like that, if you don't already know having a Google home, is like this never-ending discovery of just asking it stuff and finding out cool things that can do hey. Google play the song that goes now. I really wish that I knew how to swim. Alright I'll make a man out of you by Donny Osmond playing on Spotify, hey, Google, stop playing hey. Google change your voice here is an example of my other voice. Would you like me to use this one? No. Is this thing really worth the money at 400 bucks? It'S definitely not an insta buy for most people. I say: wait until the Apple home pod comes out, not because you might buy that instead. Well, you might buy that instead, but that's supposed to come out at 350 bucks and once it does, I wouldn't be surprised to see the price with this drop to match that they're still pretty different in a lot of ways. Google assistant is way better than Siri home pods like half the size, but it'll have some different, smart audio features and I think that'll make it competitive. But if that doesn't convince you, then you'll probably just be better off getting the original Google home. And then you can use the money you save to buy an actual nice set of bookshelf speakers or TV speakers or whatever you want, but until then I actually really like this thing. I happen to fall in the extremely narrow niche of people who will love it, and I do and I'm keeping it that's been it thanks for watching, talked to you guys, the next one peace """
9Ca8zWJOlFQ,Apple iPhone X Review: The Best Yet!,15:55,"Hey what's up guys mkbhd here, and this is iphone 10 and it's my favorite iphone ever by far and there's no doubt that in the history of iphones, this thing is iconic, it's more modern. It finally feels like a new iphone. That'S a big part of why I like it so much, but that's also the source for a few sore spots. There'S a learning curve to this phone. Unlike any other iPhone, you see, every other iPhone ever has just been home. Button rectangle screen rounded corners, pretty much. The same thing you note you're getting yourself into you know exactly how to use it, and if there's going to be one big new feature every year, it takes you two seconds to learn it and you're good. I phone 10 is different with this phone there's. Maybe three or four big fundamental changes to the way you use the phone. Now, it's very clearly still an iPhone. You still mostly know how to use it, but there's a couple things that are different, that you'll have to get used to so on. The outside is the shape we're used to the rectangle with rounded corners, but this is the first time the display itself actually has curved corners and it's pushed right up to the edges of the phone, or at least closer than they've, ever been the commercials make. It seem a little more dramatic than it actually is, but hey it's 2017 phones have small bezels, that's just the way they are now so in that way, the iPhone catches up and it pushes everything to the corners and keeps all the front-facing sensors in the knotch. That'S forsaken, not at the top. It'S actually not that big of a deal but we'll get into that soon. Just holding the phone, though it feels great, I think it's an awesome size, but if there were a bigger iPhone 10 plus, I would totally get that right. Now, despite the larger display, the 10 is definitely closer to feeling like an iPhone 8. Then an 8 plus. It still feels like a smaller phone compared to the others. I'Ve used and also thanks to the stainless steel sides. It'S definitely slippery and it's definitely going to slide out of your pocket at least once it happens to the best of them and it's crazy, the silver it's so shiny. And honestly, we all know your phone is never going to look as good as it does fresh out the box, unlike the more matte finish of the previous iPhone, I'm not convinced this super shiny, finish on the iPhones rails is going to last, like this we've seen This before in other products, it definitely gets chipped and scratched. You probably already know I usually go for a matte black skin here, which not gon na lie still looks pretty good, but deep brands got something new for the 10. The grip so like the name implies this thing is supposed to be the best way to grip. Your phone look for a full review of this bumper later this month, but I'll leave a link below. If you want to check this one out, a lot of people were asking about it when I showed it in my Instagram story, but overall it's a pretty complete hardware package as you'd expect from a thousand-dollar smartphone. You know it's the speaker's, even though they aren't front-facing are still pretty good. Its water-resistant, which gives you some nice peace of mind. It has wireless charging, it's no headphone jack welcome to 2017, but overall, it's well considered and well put together. Is it now officially the most breakable iPhone ever thanks to having glass on the back? Yes, yes, the one part of the hardware of this phone - I actually really don't like, is the camera bump, but not just for the usual reason like rocking on a table. I'Ve just kind of accepted that at this point, but because of the new orientation a couple times, I've noticed it's easy to accidentally get your finger in the photo or video you're taking just cuz. It'S all up in the corner. It might take a couple days to get used to that and stop getting your finger and the corner of your shots, but what's really become the signature feature of the iPhone 10. These are on the front and it is that notch up at the top of the display, and there are two camps with this number one. Is I hate it? It'S ugly. I wish it wasn't there and number two: is I actually don't notice it anymore and just like with the essential phone, I tend to fall more in camp number. Two, when you want to make a 20-17 phone and you want to shrink the bezels, you still have to put all the front-facing sensors, all of the cameras and the IR blaster and the depth sensor. You have to put that somewhere in 2017. Some manufacturers keep a smaller traditional bezel to house it. Some try to go no top bezel and put everything in the chin. So I'm try to minimize all the bezels and use a sort of a cutout. Knotch Apple has decided to go with a knotch and I don't mind it in fact, I literally don't even think about it anymore in everyday use. Now, obviously, when you're focusing on it here, as I'm talking about it and highlighting it on video, it's really obvious. You know the unibrow at the top. It kind of just becomes a part of this iPhone tens character, but you're never really looking at it during normal use like flipping through apps scrolling through Twitter Instagram, whatever it disappears pretty quick. Now not everybody feels this way. Clearly, like oh I've, seen all the clever like hiding the notch stuff, all the apps and the wallpapers, and that I get that, but because this is Apple and because they're stubborn and will never admit that any of their solutions are anything other than perfect. They'Ve. Come up with the opposite solution, which is embrace the notch, so in all their software and all the software they'll promote is apps that wrap right around that notch and fill up the whole display. That'S what an optimized iPhone 10 app looks like, and since this is a taller aspect, ratio apps will have to get updated to do. This developers will have to get on their horse and actually put in the work and update their apps to get them to fill up. The display like this and to be fair, most of the big-name apps, are already upgrading and embracing the notch like apple wants, but there are still plenty that haven't updated yet and they'll be obvious when you see them because they'll have these big bezels up at the Top and the bottom kind of like you're using them on an iPhone 8 again so slowly over the next couple of weeks and months, all the apps you are using will get updated to embrace that notch, whether you like it or not, it just takes some time. Probably the biggest change developers have had to make to their apps for a new iPhone since the beginning. So for the record, the only time I really think about that notch is when I'm watching videos. Yes, it gets kind of awkward here because, when you're watching videos fullscreen the notch will cut off some of the display some of what you're trying to watch. So if you want to avoid that, you can actually double tap and it'll bring in the video you're watching on this OLED display. Now you have some more bezels, but at this point now the video you're watching is so small. You might as well not be watching it on a bigger screen. It feels like the same size as the iPhone 8, so this whole thing is the main reason why I would actually want a plus size iPhone 10 anyway. As for the rest of the display, it's great Apple calls it a super Retina display. I just call it their first OLED in a smart phone ever finally - and it's it's pretty awesome, it's a 5.8 inch panel high pixel density. It supports the p3 color gamut HDR. It has true tone: it doesn't get as bright and saturated as Samsung's like no 8 and s8 displays, but it is still bright enough. Not too cartoonish with the colors has a small blue shift when you tilt it off axis, but so do many other, Oh LEDs, to varying degrees, and it still has 3d touch, although I pretty much stopped using that completely, except for lock screen controls that I wish. I could change so the screen is awesome and it's a big part of why this phone looks so good from so many angles, so a good job, Samsung. Now, of course, when you go to a full screen display like this, you lose the home button. So that's. Why iPhone 10 replaces that home button with whole bunch of gestures? This is the biggest learning curve of any iPhone ever, but it's still not that bad. You swipe up from that bar at the bottom of the screen at any time to go home now, anytime, you see that bar it represents the home and whatever app you're in will close itself just like any other iPhone hitting a home button swipe down from the Top for notifications, but now swipe from the right corner for your control center and for multitasking. Again, you have no home button, so you swipe halfway up and then over to get through your recent apps that'll, get you to that same card style carousel as before, but overall, once you get hang of this system once you get used to all this swiping which Took me a couple days, it felt pretty natural. I actually started trying to swipe up on other phones, which shows you how weird how much I got used to that. The one that took me the longest was multitasking because I started off thinking you had to swipe up then wait and then the cards show up, but that always felt so slow. But what you really have to do to get this to work. Is you swipe up and over, and I gets you to the cards way faster, so that's a pro tip for anyone who is still swiping up halfway and waiting for the cards to show up like I was you're welcome and for those with small hands or who Just really liked reach ability on the bigger iPhone. You technically still have it here, it's buried in the accessibility settings, but you can do the little swipe down on the bottom of the screen to bring the top corners within reach, and that makes getting a top gesture. Is easier with one hand, I leave that on it's pretty useful, sometimes now, of course, the other big change that comes with ditching the home button on iPhone 10. Is he also just ditched that fingerprint reader, which means, as you may have heard they needed to replace that with face ID facial recognition face ID on the iPhone works? Really well most of the time? It'S not perfect and I think touch ID was close perfect. As far as fail rate goes, but it's still impressively good here, I talked about how touch ID is like the gold standard for quickly and securely getting into your phone in the previous video I'll link that below the like button, of course, and I still believe that Touch ID is definitely still faster, but face ID can get better with software updates and with time, as millions of people begin to use it, I think that'll happen, and it still also has some physical limitations that you can become aware of and avoid just like touch Id had some physical limitations that you could become aware of like when your fingers wet, or it doesn't quite work because of stuff on your hands or if you have a glove on stuff like that, you just know touch IDs, not gon na work. So you put in the passcode face ID has some physical limitations. It works by bouncing thousands of little infrared dots off your face and back into the sensor and creating a map of your eyes, nose and mouth. It doesn't actually use the front-facing camera and it can learn a changing face over time. It still recognizes you when you get a haircut or shave a beard or put makeup on. None of this stuff has a huge effect on the dot map that made of your face. It also won't be tricked by a picture of you, because that doesn't have the depth of your face, and I can also work through some pairs of sunglasses again. The ones where the infrared light can get through but face ID has been known to fail when you're backlit or when there's like a ton of extra infrared light coming in basically from the Sun. It'S like how a dim flashlight doesn't work when it's really bright out same thing. Face ID is gon na get blinded by all that extra infrared light just got ta type in your passcode, but those times for me were few and far between. If touch IDs. Success rate was 99 % to me. It felt like face IDs success rate was like 95 %. Now I can add up when you unlock your phone hundreds of times a day, but again this can get better as it gets used more there's even some settings as well, where you can turn attention on, so it won't unlock if you're just holding the phone up To your face, not only that, but you have to be looking at your phone, then it'll unlock and show all your notification data works pretty well for me. Just please don't do this while driving and even if face ID. Is this workaround not getting the fingerprint reader underneath the glass in time for this phone? I still think that, at its best, facial recognition on a phone is closer to secure, seamless authentication than a separate fingerprint reader ever would be, because with this you just pick up the phone and it works. You use it. You login you pay for stuff, you download, apps, etc, but if someone else picks up your phone, it won't work. It'S that simple and then there is an emoji, possibly maybe the most fun feature of iPhone 10. But you know it's hilarious. These moving facial, tracking and emoji are iPhone 10 exclusive. You can't get this on any other iPhone. So if you get one of these, then you know the person that sent it has an iPhone 10 and weirdly enough. If you send this to someone with an Android phone, they just get a video message of this an emoji, but here's the thing an emoji is just using the front-facing camera check this out. An emoji is working and continues to work. Even when you cover the depth. Sensors and the extra front-facing sensors all that stuff it'll work when you cover everything, except for it, the front-facing camera, which means they totally could have made these available for any other iPhone, but they didn't man, an emoji is the classic. I have an iPhone and you don't feature classic Apple. Iphone 10 also has some slightly new cameras, same exact sensors for both cameras as the iPhone 8 plus, but slightly better glass, and now both are optically stabilized. So this is gon na get you some meaningfully better performance with the 2x telephoto lens and zoomed in photos and zoomed in videos. Things like that which is good to see because I avoided using it with previous iPhones and as you'd expect photos from the iPhone 10. Look awesome, I'm especially happy with how much dynamic range we're getting HDR on previous iPhone cameras used to be a lot less aggressive, and I kept asking over and over for a little more a little more and now photos really pop. The sky is like always so blue details. Their color accuracy is tight. It'S not as good as the pixel twos camera, just gon na say that right up front, but this is a top 5 smartphone camera and no doubt if you want a video sample check out the Tesla rap video I'll link it below that's 5 minutes of 4k Video from the sensor right there, if you want to watch that and despite his tendency to overexpose, I think it might be the best front-facing camera for video for any smartphone they've, also added portrait mode to the front-facing camera for portrait selfies on the 10. But it doesn't work nearly as well edges get blurred super hard almost to a comical amount when compare it to something like the pixel or even the back facing camera. But the thing is: pixel. Does all this so much better because of machine learning and software? So in theory, iPhone 10 can keep learning and get this good plus it already has better color accuracy, so I'll be on the lookout for that software update. Now you may have noticed. We'Ve made it all this way into an iPhone review without talking about any of the specs shows how important that is, but iPhone 10 is rocking the a11 Bionic chip and three gigs of ram, and it's awesome. In fact. It'S really really good. I would say this is the most powerful mobile chipset in any smartphone right now the benchmarks are insane, but this isn't for iOS. This is for all the things that run on top of iOS the augmented reality apps the image processing, the super slow-motion video. All of that stuff at iOS is still iOS. As you know, I mean it obviously feels more modern because of all the swiping and the gestures now, but as far as functionality, it has all the same stuff and features you're used to has all the same. Quirks are used to like iOS. This notification system is still a mess, since they don't group apps together. This is still easily fixable, but there's plenty of other things I wish would be different about iOS, but it's Apple, they're, stubborn you'll, get used to it and battery life on the iPhone 10 has turned out to be pretty great close to the iPhone 8 plus. I would say again: iPhone is a champ of standby time and it always has been so no problems there and it handles the biggest iPhone display ever pretty. Well, thanks to it being an OLED, I haven't had any problems getting to the end of a single day with full use. If you want to use that screen on time metric, it's usually around 6 hours, so the bottom line and the question that I get the most often about this phone is so what do you think and if you made it this far in the video you already Know what I think, but in case you skipped to this part, this is my favorite iPhone. Ever by far. I really like it is it worth $ 1000. Honestly, I don't think people spending the money on this phone will be disappointed. Now, that's not to say this thing is perfect. It clearly still also has its downsides. You know the fact that it's all glass on the back more breakable, that's a downside. The notch on the front for a lot of people, that's a downside, no headphone jack! Still a downside, but those are all things that I think people who are buying this phone are already used to or were expecting, and for that reason it's not a deal-breaker in 2017, so I'm happy to be carrying this phone. So if you were thinking about going out and getting this phone go ahead, I think you'll like it too, until the next one there's been mkbhd. Thank you for watching tuffsy as the next one peace. """
wd9-VP2LzM8,Google Home Mini Review: Smart Home for $49?,5:27,"Yo, what is up guys my PhD here - and this is Google home mini it's 49 bucks, and that's almost all that matters here. We already had the original Google home, which I think right now is 129, but this little one is a game-changer because it does all of the exact same stuff, the big one does, but for less than half the price and in a way smaller package. So here's everything you need to know if you're considering getting a Google home Mini. First of all, I reviewed the original Google home. I have a couple of them now in the studio and at home. It looks like this. Pretty solid Google, home Mini looks like this. It comes in three different colors, the coral choc and charcoal, and I know the size and the scale is sometimes hard to show. So there you go right around 4 inches across it's like the size of a doughnut and when you plug it in it basically looks like this fabric pebble with lights. I feel like it could kind of blend into almost any room in most houses pretty easily, especially in this gray, color volume up volume down and long press to actually physically trigger the assistant. Otherwise, you can do it with your voice, of course, because there are microphones and then you pair it up with the Google home app on your iPhone or Android phone and you're good to go again. Everything is the same here as the bigger Google home. The only physical disadvantage of being smaller is the smaller speaker here. Obviously, the single upward firing speaker can't give you quite the same volume as the 3 speaker setup of the Google home, which is kind of a big deal for some people. Maybe those who listen to music a lot but for most this single speaker is really just fine. So night, Google actually calls it a 360 degree sound, but that's just their way of making a single upward firing driver sound cool, but it's just basically it's unidirectional. There'S no other direction one big speaker could face. I just do you think it would benefit from having an audio jack for people who actually just want to plug it into some speakers and benefit from better sound and while we're on it. I do have some other minor complaints about the hardware number one I wish it was USB see they went with micro USB, even though it's 2017 - and this thing only has one port, it could have easily been USB, see come on Google, but then the bigger complaint Is the mute switch it's actually kind of annoying? You can already mute Google home by asking it to, but in the case that you actually want a physical button, the regular Google home has a button on the back to quickly mute it. You just press it again to unmute it, but if you mute, Google, home mini with your voice, then when you go to unmute it with the switch you got to flip it once and then flip it back, because it was already flipped to unmuted. When you started. It'S like those rooms with two light switches, like ones up and ones down, but you want to turn the lights on with one to turn it down and then it turn it up and it just it's out of sync after a while but online is it should Have been a button, not a switch would have been much easier, but from there everything else about this $ 49. Google, home Mini, is exactly the same as the $ 129 regular size, Google, home. So all the same commands the same phone call ability the same AI. All that useful stuff - hey Google, Find My Phone. Yes, hey, Google, how long have there been sharks on earth 420 million years on the website, shark savers or say, hey? Google? What is this surface temperature of the Sun? Hey Google show me essential phone videos, sure playing essential phone videos from YouTube on studio. Is it going to rain today? Yes, the forecast for today in Kearny is 77 degrees Fahrenheit with rain, hey, Google. What'S the tallest building in Europe, tallest buildings in Europe include OCO tower at 1,000 160 feet. Hey Google play a b-flat sure. Here'S a b-flat, hey Google roll a 12-sided die coming right up. It'S a three: hey Google! How many pints are in a quart? It'S pretty easy, so this fits nicely in a sort of a lineup. Now they have the Google home Mini and the regular one and the Mac's at like three weight, different price points and it's still gaining features as time goes on. So, like there's stuff that hasn't been fully activated yet I can't do texting yet on my Google homes, but that's something that'll be available soon. So that's basically it it's a mini review for a mini speaker. Again, it's all stuff we've seen before, but the main new thing really here is just the price being forty, nine bucks brings it down into competition with all the people considering buying Amazon echo dot. That'S also about 45 bucks right now. So let me know if that new price point is enough to possibly convince you and the comments below I'll hang out down there. That'S pretty much it.

ld5H2L4j6LE,iPhone 8 Review: Skip this Great Phone!,10:27,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm poppy HD here, and this is the iPhone 8 review and yes, I know iPhone 10 is like right around the corner. This is true, but as of right now, this is the newest and best iPhone. So here's the thing. This is actually a really great phone in a lot of ways, but it's gon na tend to go under the radar and really the only reason I'm telling you to probably skip this is because of that iPhone 10. It'S just better, but I'm gon na try to review this phone in a vacuum as if we don't know that this is about to be one-upped. So this is everything you need to know about iPhone 8. So on the outside aesthetically, it's very similar to iPhone 7, of course same layout, it's the same dimensions. Actually, so old cases will work with it as well same camera, bump same general. Look, it just looks like an iPhone again, the one biggest difference. Besides, the new colors is the glass on the back, so this glass is a bit heavier a bit grippier actually than rounded metal and a bit more fingerprint t naturally, but most of all it's more breakable than aluminum. So that's something to note, even if you are using the strongest glass ever Apple, it's glass. The finish is really nice, though, as you'd expect, everything on the back of the phone is underneath the glass, so the Apple logo is no longer a cutout in the metal. It'S behind the glass that iPhone logo. The text is behind the glass, even the dual flash is under the glass, so it's all smooth to the touch, but the main reason they went with the glass is wireless charging. So iPhone 8 now supports Qi. Enabled wireless charging through that glass, so any of those wireless charging pads you see at Starbucks or on those ikea tables or at a Samsung users bedside table. The iPhone can now use those two nice clearly not first, but still nice. It doesn't have to be first to be nice. In fact, it's really nice that the iPhone is getting Qi, enabled wireless charging and not some proprietary standard, because that now means we're gon na start. Seeing these Qi wireless charging accessories everywhere that work with all of the phones that already support it, I mean think about it. If the iPhone can make the Apple watch an accessory, the most popular watch in the world then seems like the iPhone. Getting Wireless charge should also be able to make that pretty popular thanks Apple and also, if you thinking what I'm thinking then yet that Space Gray iPhone 8 is another fingerprint magnet for real reflections. I can deal with that's just something: that's on every glass phone fingerprints, not so much. They show up a lot more on the Space Gray, but you can grab a deep brown skin to cover that up and it might actually look better with the matte black than the glossy Space Gray. Just on that out there so I'll link this one below so around the front. The iPhone 8 and 8 plus have mostly the same displays as before, still IPS still the same resolution and everything, but they now support true tone, which was something I was in iPads before. Essentially, what it does is when you turn it on it, adjusts the color temperature of the screen to match the lighting of whatever environment you're in so under certain lights. That makes the display itself more yellow under other lights. It'S closer to blue. All of it is to stay visually consistent to the eye, it's technically less accurate, but also tends to look better, so I'm cool with it. I leave it on as long as I'm not editing or like making something we're accurate color. Really matters really, I'm just sad. There'S no promotion display no OLED display no resolution bump, you know still 1080p in 2017 seriously. You could say I'm even disappointed with the display or lack of a display upgrade, but it is what it is. It'S still, I guess the best IPS display in any smartphone. Also, the speakers are 25 % louder on iPhone 8. I honestly, I don't hear much of a loudness difference. It sounds to me more like a clarity difference these just sound better, but yet everything else knew about the iPhone eight is on the inside, and that would be with the cameras and the specs. So when we originally got this announcement, I thought this would be some pretty minor upgrades. You know slightly new camera bump. We see that every year and of course, then you specs the a 11 Bionic chip it'll be faster, but we may or may not notice that. But these two things have actually really impressed me and turns out. They'Ve actually enabled some things that literally no other smartphone right now can do the a11 Bionic chip is ridiculously powerful. It is the fastest ship in any smartphone right now and it's not close the benchmark show it the everyday. You shows it it's more powerful and more efficient than any other chipset, which is awesome in a phone so because of this number one battery life has actually improved significantly because of this efficiency. Essentially, it's not working as hard and is smarter about what cores fire up when so iPhone 8 and 8 plus have really good battery life. In fact, I'd say with the 5 plus hours of consistent screen on time, I'm getting and a full day of heavy use. Ending with 20 % seems like this is back to being the battery life king of the hill, with the 8 plus, and then everyday performance is excellent. I mean iOS 11 is already pretty smooth on a brand new phone anyway, but I made a separate video all about its best features. Essentially, though, it means that this is much more future-proof. A super high powered chip like this should ideally keep the phone running smooth for years to come as apps and services get more intensive. A prime example of that is all the new augmented reality. Applications. This stuff takes a lot more processing power to run smoothly, but, like this sky guide, really cool stuff like this has started to pop up for iOS. That tracks really smoothly shows a ton of information over your real life and renders and high-quality color me impressed and then the super powerful chip enables some seriously impressive video features in the camera. That again, you really don't see. Many other places. 4K 60 frames per second video and 1080p 240 frames per second slo-mo. These are things you barely find on any other smartphone, let alone an actual, dedicated video camera. Right now I mean the new GoPro. Does my red camera? Does it, but that's about it not much else, and it's not just that the frame rates are high, but the quality is really good. 211 Bionic has room for much better dedicated image processing and it's excellent with things like noise reduction and high dynamic range and contrast and sharpness and detail, and all of that yeah. They are also technically new, 12 megapixel sensors. So I give them credit for that. Its new hardware, new cameras for both the 8 and A also put a new secondary telephoto camera for the plus, but wow. I did not think they would be this good and, yes, I did get the highest ever rating from dick, so mark, but I wouldn't put too much stock in the comparative numbers. They'Re just know that photo quality has taken a noticeable step up and even though the next Google pixel is right around the corner and iPhone 10 with slightly better glasses, also incoming the photos. I'Ve gotten from this phone have pretty much cemented it in the top 5 smartphone cameras of this year. It'S that good, it right off the bat if you're in a photography, iPhone 8 will not disappoint. There'S also the new improvements to portrait mode on the 8 plus. So you can now take these portrait photos and adjust the portrait lighting effects during or after you've taken the photo and they try to mimic different types of contrast to you lighting if you're trying to take that to the next level they're a little bit interesting. The first few actually do a pretty decent job. I think they're likely to get better with software updates in the future. The last two, though, with the super dramatic stage light they kind of look a bit more like cartoon cutouts. If you don't get them perfect, so I would advise to, I guess: use them sparingly unless you want to be the first one with that stage, light profile picture so yeah the camera is really good. The performance is really good. The battery life is on point. I mean it's not a whole lot to complain about with these new phones, except the fact that the design is so brutally outdated for 2017. In this price point, in fact, I saved all my complaints here for the end of the video ready. It gets a little bit too warm when wireless charging, I mean other phones. I'Ve used in the past couple years also get warm to varying degrees when they're on the charging pad iPhone is definitely near the high end of that spectrum and wireless charging isn't perfect. You need contact with that pad and as soon as you want to use the phone and pick it up, it stops charging unless you pick up the phone and the charger every time, but that's not unique to the iPhone come with the USBC fast charger in the Box, iPhone 8 is capable of some really fast charging speeds with the USBC, but it won't get those speeds with the out of the box wall adapter. You need to pay extra for that, that's pretty lame. I wish they used this entire huge bezel up at the front to put a real front facing speaker, even if it's only one side of the phone, this earpiece really isn't that loud. It'S not adding much. It would be better than nothing right now. It'S kind of weak and for this price, of course, I wish the display was OLED. I wish it was a higher resolution too. I wish it was a bit brighter, but really I wish it got a lot closer to the edges, I'm overall just kind of bored with the screen and the design at this point and of course it still does not have a headphone jack yeah. Obviously, I can't pretend I think that's coming back, but I have to say it: it doesn't have one so that's iPhone eight. Is it boring heck yeah? You could say it's boring, especially on the outside we've seen it before, but for that a 11 Bionic chip for us nerds. That really is something else I mean I'll, say it again. It really is actually a great phone, but the only reason I'm telling you to skip this one is because we know iPhone 10 is coming out in like a month. I'D say the only reason to get this phone over the upcoming iPhone 10 is. If you really want to save the 200 bucks which a lot of people will or if you just absolutely have to have a smaller device, that iPhone 10 does have a pretty big display. So this is actually smaller than that or if you just really really need to keep touch ID for some reason, but really a big part of why Apple made this phone and sort of fit it in with the iPhone 10 and the other prices. So they could offer a phone an iPhone at each of these major buying prices. All of these are for sale on Apple comm right now and that's a nice even spread. It'S a gradient of prices to offer an iPhone for any budget. So the timing is kind of weird, with iPhone 8 coming out right before iPhone 10 and it's probably very tempting to pick up iPhone 8. But you already heard what it said so just bring all this money right now for what's about to be the second best iPhone, I mean it's not a bad phone, but when the better ones clearly around the corner seems like it's an obvious choice to recommend that One feels weird to tell you to skip a great phone, but there you have it but hey. Even if you do go with iPhone 8, you probably won't be disappointed there. You have it. Thank you for watching talk to you guys, the next one peace """
wQD1JvJZXdI,Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Review: A $1000 Android!,10:45,"Hey what is up guys of kabhi HD here and this phone, this Galaxy Note 8. This is the best phone Samsung makes right now I'll go ahead and say that right off the bat, it's also the most expensive phone samsung made. So last year's Note 7 kind of went onto the radar because of the sales, stopping and obviously everything that happened to it, but it was low-key one of my favorite phones of last year before all that sort of blew up. Oh wow, that's a that's a bad joke, but Galaxy Note. 8 is again trying to be one of those phones that checks all the boxes, and that is a great smart phone. This is clearly Samsung's attempt at making their best smartphone possible. It'S swinging for the fences. It'S trying to hit a homerun, so let's treat it like that and let's see if you should buy one or not, let's break it down. So if you recall some of my previous reviews, I've had about five pillars of a great smartphone, those five and if a phone does all those five things well then it's probably worth the money seems like a complete package. I'Ll give you the green light to buy it recommendation is go Galaxy. Note, 8. Does four of those five things really well like not just good but great, but then kind of fall short on the last thing, but then it kind of makes it up its own. Sixth category, with a bunch of extra stuff that it kind of throws in there and doesn't have to nail this category, it's not part of the essential five pillars. I don't think, but it kind of is why people would end up buying this phone. It'S what makes the note the note so Samsung's build quality has been on point for a while. Now this is a refinement of last year, which is a refinement of the year before that and the year before that. But you can see the display melts over the edges of the sides and gets pretty damn close to the top and bottom bezels. It'S not bezel this, but I'd say that 83 % screen to body ratio is very 2017 and it's super refined versus previous years. Like I said so, the edges aren't sharp anymore. It has this overall boxy shape, but there's still an aluminum rail to hold, there's no camera bump or protrusion at all on the back, so it doesn't rock on a table and I honestly think Samsung has had the best industrial design in smartphones in the past two Or three years - and the note is no exception to that rule - I mean they kind of played a part in making this glass sandwich design more popular in today's world of smartphones. We see it everywhere now, which some people don't like because of fingerprints, maybe or possibly dropping it, maybe being more breakable, but even those two things could be easily fixable with some like a deep branch skin and that has zero effect on wireless charging. The worst part about it I'd say, is the fingerprint reader placement it's way up high next to the camera, and on this really big phone it means there's absolutely no natural way to hold the phone while using it and be able to reach this fingerprint. It requires a like a hand shuffle to reach it. It'S not a huge issue, because you don't have to use a fingerprint scanner, but I prefer, for the record, a fingerprint reader in the middle of the back of the phone, so yeah for this badass. Looking super sturdy, metal and glass premium, fully water sealed like edge to edge, display beautiful when clean type of look Galaxy. Note 8 definitely checks that box and then the display it's also the single best display in any smartphone again. Somehow they keep getting better at this. This time it's a six point: three inch, 20 960 by 1440 Super AMOLED display and it's gorgeous in all conditions. I sent us a couple months ago: galaxy s 8 and galaxy s 8 plus had the best display now note: it's panel is the same resolution but bigger and brighter 1200 nits now versus a thousand and there's pretty much perfectly viewable outdoors, which really matters when navigating Or in a car or something - and of course, since it's an OLED colors are awesome, blacks are pitch. Black contrast ratios are incredible: it's super sharp, it's even HDR 10 compliant, and it still keeps the pressure sensitive home button at the bottom of the glass. On top of all of that side note, I still think this implementation is best. We'Re probably gon na see a lot more edge to edge displays and phones this year, and you kind of wonder what you do with the home button. We used to see on every smartphone, I think until we see that fingerprint reader under the glass, this sort of pressure, sensitive area to go home whenever you want, is the way that we should do it. But I think the bottom line here is in the display Department. Galaxy Note, 8 also checks that box and then the camera on the note 8 is still one of the best in any smartphone. Again, it's rocking a 12 megapixel, F, 1.7 primary camera and an additional 12 megapixel camera with an F 2.4 telephoto lens, and this time both have optical image, stabilization, making it the first phone to do that and the quality is about what you'd expect from Samsung. It'S the same characteristics, you've kind of seen by now, just a little extra saturation in the colors, a little extra sharpening from corn to corner it's like a little bit less realistic, but a little bit prettier than real life, and I'm continually impressed at how well these Things handle the more extreme colors and high dynamic range seriously. Very few cameras handle Reds this well in this shot. The Sun is actually right behind the hotel, but you can see the detail still in the clouds in the sky and in most outdoor shots. You can count on getting detail both in the lightest and darkest parts of the exposure. Even this backlit shot looks totally fine and it's safe to bring this thing into low light, of course, as well, obviously being optically stabilized and letting in a ton of light, helps out a lot with that. So there's a lot of good things happening with the camera. Puts it firmly in confident point shoot territory, meaning if you see a subject that you just want to take a picture of just a double top of the home button point and shoot and you'll probably get a good shot so that second lens they added for that Telephoto zoom, I found it kind of hit or miss, actually it's not as good as the main camera, and I can actually tell the difference in quality with the 1x vs. 2x photos. So sometimes I actually didn't want to use it as much. I would rather take a photo with the main camera and zoom in a bit later, which kind of defeats the purpose. But so one thing it did sometimes really work well with was live photos which is their version of the portrait mode we've seen coming to. So many smartphones lately, so with the note 8, it's called live photos because you can adjust the amount of blur you have in the background and see the effect in the viewfinder live, which is pretty cool. You take the photo and then you can adjust the amount of blur after the photo is taken, and it also takes a simultaneous photo with the main camera. Just in case that portrait one isn't good enough. So we're doing a lot with that. Second, camera you may or may not find it useful. You may never even use it, but the fact that it's there and it works well alongside one of the best main cameras in any smartphone means it definitely checks that box and then with performance. This thing is a monster. It has some high end, some might say best-in-class hardware on the inside Snapdragon 835 Adreno 546 gigs of ram, and it moves through Samsung's skin. Just fine, that's not quite the smoothness level of phones that are much closer to stock Android. I feel the need to mention this like I noticed that, mostly when scrolling through a lot of big heavy stuff or through multitasking, especially it's not quite as fast, but it's not really a big enough deal to be a bad thing like it's just a tiny delay. I noticed because I use a lot of other phones but gaming and moving through apps and web browsing and all that other stuff has no problems on this phone, but that doesn't mean I can't wish for a Google Play edition like old times. So, as you probably expect from a flagship that has these kind of specs inside, it checks the performance box too. So then we get to battery life and that's the one box I can't say Galaxy - Note: 8 checks. It does not have great battery life. This phone has a 3300 milliamp hour battery, which would ordinarily sound like a pretty solid size. But then you consider your packing, like the world's brightest 6.3 inch smartphone display, and then it starts to sound a little bit lacking for perspective. The galaxy s 8 plus has a smaller display, but has a larger 3500 milliamp hour battery, so for that it has much better battery life. So, first of all, the note has an entire column in the side of it that you have to use for the stylus. So you can't fit battery in there and then also the fact that they kind of don't want to push the battery to the limits. On the note, because of what happened last time, they tried that that kind of explains why it's a 3300 milliamp hour battery in this one. So with this phone you kind of have to play the battery life versus a resolution game out. The box you're gon na get this preset, which is in the middle you're, scaling down the resolution a bit, so it's kind of like they know, you're not going to get the best battery life and that right off the bat is gon na. Get you a little bit less than 4 hours of screen on time, at least with my types of usage. When you turn the resolution further down, you can definitely ensure you get to a full day, but that's a little bit less enjoyable and when you max out the resolution, which they kind of, don't want you to do unless you turn on performance mode, which is the Mode that maxes the brightness and resolution you're gon na get less than 4 hours for sure, you're gon na get 3 and a half hours of screen on time and you'll probably have to top-up the battery at some point during the day. So that's a pretty unfortunate stat. The Galaxy Note used to be that phone that power users get because of the battery life. I remember back in the early days of the Galaxy Note at CES, like all the youtubers took this phone to CES, because it checked all the boxes, it had a huge screen and it lasted forever. This is just not that same phone. It does not check the box of great battery life now all that being said, there is still the point that I made at the beginning of the video, which is the note kind of adds this sixth category of the extras and from using this phone, it's pretty Clear that this is still the phone to buy because of the extras is these little things that this phone has that others simply don't it's the iris scanner, if you're into that for unlocking your phone with just your eyes, it's the expandable storage via a micro SD. If you have a big media library or take a lot of photos and videos, it's the headphone jack yeah, that's that's become a thing. Many phones don't have now the full water-resistance, the dual cameras and all their features. The Bluetooth 5.0, with dual audio and everything that comes with that and the s-pen, which I'd say, is the best stylus experience in any phone right now for people who take a lot of notes or write a lot of things down. So these are things that separate the note 8 in a little way from other phones and give people that unique reason to buy it. As a matter of fact, it seems like the only phone. This one doesn't really separate itself from what those extras is Samsung's own Galaxy S, 8 plus, which has all of those things, except for the dual cameras and the stylus, and the difference between them is about 150 bucks. So that really is the biggest challenge. When you consider all the boxes, you want to have checked, isn't worth the extra money to get a phone. That also has the dual cameras and a stylus, but maybe doesn't have quite as good of a battery life, especially when you consider the galaxy s. 8 plus cost less. So, if you're like me - and you just want the best possible most complete phone, then Galaxy Note 8 is definitely still to buy and you kind of just have to deal with the intermittent charging up during the day. But you still have really fast fast charging and wireless charging. So if that's available to you, it's not a big deal but also consider galaxy. Si plus delivers a really really similar experience checks, one extra box with good battery and cost a bit less money. So that's a consideration if you're looking to save a few bucks, so that's pretty much it. Thank you for watching talked to you guys, the next one peace """
ftqaMBDj2oY,The Essential Phone Review: Save Your Money!,10:16,"The essential pH one essential, pH one essential, fo, see what you I see. What you did there hey? What is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here, and this is the essential phone. It'S a new phone from a new company, but with a not so new philosophy of just sticking with the essentials, you know no bells and whistles no fancy, widgets or crazy features or head-turning stuff. Just seven hundred dollars of the pure essentials I'll be using this phone for a little bit now and I have a pretty good idea of how well they did and whether you should buy one or not. So that's what this video is. So, first of all, the hardware is awesome and that's usually really hard for new companies to get right off the bat. So I'm impressed here the essential phone feels great in the hand. It'S this all-black, titanium and ceramic slab, no protrusions at all, no logos at all. No branding or anything like that, it's just an essential rectangle with rounded corners the titanium sides that material is actually a lot harder than your typical aluminum. So that means you should hold up to chipping or any drops much better and the back which you could easily mistake for Gorilla Glass is not glass at all. It is polished ceramic, so that makes it much harder than glass making it way less likely to scratch. It all, but also theoretically, making it more likely to break some ceramic is more brittle than Gorilla Glass. Basically, what I'm saying is this would be a really interesting phone to drop test, but no, I won't I'll leave that to other channels. Well, you will notice right out. The box, though, is the ceramic makes the phone a bit heavier, just more dense feeling in the hand, and it's also a serious fingerprint magnet. It'S like a mirror finish, which is super nice when it's clean, but it will never be clean, so definitely worth getting a deep brand skin on the back of this one and they can actually make the phone look a lot better than without the skin. If you ask me, this is one of those rare instances so I'll link to this matte black one right below that like button, but long story short. I liked the industrial design here. It'S simple, not too flashy but obviously still has a signature. Look the only thing. You'Re missing here is waterproofing. A lot of other phones in this price range have some IP certification, not this one. Maybe next year the favor. This guy is actually pretty quick to recognize your finger, but it always feels like there's a tiny delay when I actually turned the screen on and unlock the phone. If you can see that it's not bad, but you can definitely address that with a software update and the rest of the back of the phone is the mic and two pins for attaching small modular accessories and providing power through them. So the one that exists right now is the world's smallest 360-degree camera. It just snaps right into place with magnets on the phone which is really convenient. So hopefully there are more mods added to their ecosystems. Sooner than later, I don't have any of them right now, but we'll have to wait and see how good that gets the speaker for those who care is it's actually really loud? It gets very, very loud, but it's not like the best quality loud. So there's no big dynamic range, there's no bass or anything like that. It'S just really loud, and it's also this small, pretty blockable grill at the bottom of the phone and there's also no headphone jack anywhere on the essential phone. So audio is clearly not a priority. With this guy so yeah, I guess the easiest joke to make about the essential phone is. They didn't include a headphone jack, which is essential to most people. It seems kind of weird. Yes, I do think they could have included one, but they didn't welcome to 2017. I guess any way around the front is the 5.7 inch display with the sort of the signature look at this point, the cutout in the top of the middle for the front-facing camera and the absolutely tiny bezels on the top and the sides. Originally, I thought I wouldn't like this or it might get distracting or annoying, but I can tell you right now that disapear is just a couple hours into using it, and the phone looks awesome in my opinion, with the thin bezels. We just talked about this in the most recent video, yes, technically, moving the display way up closer to the corners would seem to make it easier to damage it with a drop, but the ceramic and titanium should also work against that and all the times that the Phone isn't using the full display. It just blocks out that bar to match the bottom bezel, so it looks like a completely normal phone most of the time. Anyway. It'S also a quad HD display and it gets up to 500 nits so decently bright, but not the brightest like I can see outdoors, but I've seen better. In fact, the only real downside I can see with this screen is that it's not an OLED. If it were an OLED, you could do some cool tricks with totally blacking out the top and the bottom or you could do some cool wallpaper tricks where it fades to complete blackness up at the, and you could do some cool essential tricks where you, like. Only light up a display for notifications instead of the whole thing little things like that, but it's not it's an LCD which you know that's just fine for now, maybe next year, but where this phone really lives up to the name, the essential is in the software. It is so clean this one is rockin, basically stock, Android 7.1.1 and I imagine it'll be getting Android 8.0 Oreo through a software update pretty soon it's already gotten two software updates. Since I got the thing and so once you get past the essential boot screen, you get, you know: stock, Google launcher stock, Android notification shade just a couple: google apps installed absolutely zero bloatware out the box, the only third-party app installed on this phone. When you get it is the camera app which we'll get to in a second. So this is delivering essentially the exact same software experience as a pixel. No extra features are buried in the settings, no waving gestures or iris scanning no extra assistance, or any of that. The essential part in the settings is just to tick whether or not you want to send diagnostic data to the company or not it's just just Android. It'S clean the pure base essentials, and so of course, because of that performance is great. I mean it's also because of the specs to you know: Snapdragon 835, four gigs of ram. You don't need the craziest specs to run pure android smoothly, but this phone balls-out gaming is fine. Multitasking is fine. Hiccups aren't at zero, but they're minimal and lag doesn't happen. Much at all, except in the camera, in fact, you know what. Let'S let's talk about the camera? This is the weakest part of the device straight up. So if you were looking for a reason not to buy this phone, if you want to tell someone why not to buy it, link them to this part of the video, the essential phone actually has two cameras on the back: a 13 megapixel color camera and a 13 megapixel monochrome, camera and they're used together to enhance the detail and contrast and sharpness in everyday regular photos. Unfortunately, most people will never actually notice this, so the only other benefit just ends up being. It can also take black-and-white photos in the camera app and the camera. App is the only app that I've ever really seen lag hard on this phone and it's been pretty consistently slow. It lags to take photos, it lags when turning HDR on and off and it lags big-time when switching between modes. If you have a lot of stuff going on, so that's really disappointing and it's not even like it's a super complex camera app. In fact, it's one of the simplest camera apps possible every option available to change is shown on the screen right now, so there's no other hidden settings, there's no manual mode, no pro mode. This is it and then the photos themselves are pretty mediocre. At best again, you would think a phone at this price that adds a second sensor. Just to add, detail and dynamic range would be great with the sharpness and photos. Something seems like it really focuses on photography, but the photos from this phone are still soft, they're, lacking dynamic range, they're, noisy and anything but perfect lighting and often have the totally wrong exposure all together. Turning HDR on also didn't help as much as I thought it would you've seen HDR from other phones like the s8 and the pixel they're great, but this one barely adds a little bit back to the highlights and that's it so the lacking camera and camera app Here are pretty disappointing, even the videos off it are really shaky and also disappointing. The one thing about photos - and videos, though, is they can be improved via software updates. In fact, that's usually the number one thing that gets the most improved over time with smartphones software updates, but I've still never seen one go from not good to really good with just software updates, so I feel pretty safe, saying you're not gon na want to buy This phone for the camera: well, you should buy this phone for our the great stock software experience. That'S pretty obvious! It'S clean and pretty unique. You could buy it for the premium, build quality, the ceramic and titanium. As far as I can see, aren't combined like this. In any other smartphone, you might even get it for the battery life. This thing gets great battery life. It'S been really impressive for a 3040 milliamp hour battery and a 5.7 inch display, but I keep getting four to four and a half hours of screen on time. So it lasts comfortably all day, you might even get it for just the little things you like about it. The display the tiny notification LED right above the screen, which gets a really bright or Bluetooth 5.0, or even the awesome accessories included in the box, which are also first of all, totally non branded no logo anywhere, but also really high-quality and really cool to see a Smartphone bundle Brady high-quality cables in the box that feel like they're gon na last, a long time and a super high-powered 27 watt charger. That goes extremely fast, so the bottom line is what I would I recommend buying this phone and as much as I enjoyed using it. Probably not don't get me wrong. It'S awesome to see a new company get so much right in their first try, but at the same time it is 700 bucks. So it's kind of for me, like it's floating around in that void of other, really good. Smart phones from the established manufacturers. For the same price, you could get a Galaxy s8 that also has a software skin, but also has a way better camera and also has waterproofing and a headphone jack all for the same price. You could also get a Google pixel from last year, which may have bigger bezels, but it has better speakers and it gets the exact same software updates put way faster. We can just wait for the new pixel to come out this year. That will have smaller bezels and the new software. So a central phone to me is a great episode, one, it's a great start and I'm excited for episode 2, when essential phone 2 comes out, hopefully has 1 or 2 more distinguishing features at that price range. That aren't proprietary, mods and then I'll be really into it and I'll probably be more likely to recommend it. But until then this is still really cool to see. Save your money thanks for watching, talked to you guys, the next one peace """
2w5B1Ne-fy4,OnePlus 5 Review!,10:10,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm Kip EHD here - and this is the one plus five and just like every smartphone in the past three years, there's been leaks, there's been rumors, there's been, renders there's been speculation, but now it's real it's here in the flesh - and this Is everything you need to know so one plus is history, is actually pretty limited in there, a young small company and because they're a small company, they actually don't have the access to all this super high-end tech that the apples and Samsung's and Motorola's and HTC's of The world do that's a disadvantage, but the advantage to being a small company is. You can actually listen to what your core fan base and what your core customers actually want and try to give them that exact product. So one plus 5 is another incremental improvement. Over 1 plus 3t, with a few big bullet point changes and a couple minor touch-ups. So first thing: you'll notice is the insane specs. You can tell it's an enthusiast brand here: snapdragon 835 Adreno, 546 or 8 gigabytes of RAM and 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage. A dual camera system on the back 16 and 20 megapixel cameras, bluetooth, 5.0, a 3300 milliamp hour battery and a 5.5 inch 1080p AMOLED display and, of course, an updated unibody metal design. Ok, so not bad, let's break it all down the all-new design is what's turning heads this time you saw the renders, and then you saw all the replies. You probably saw all the YouTube comments. Oh from the back, it looks like an iPhone they're copying Apple they've become a copycat company. Honestly, I only agree with some of this I mean. Obviously the render is when we saw them from that. One angle that obviously looks like an iPhone because it's got the dual camera system up in the top left corner. Okay, I get that. But honestly, if you look at the whole entire body of the phone, it does resemble some other phones, even more so than this one seriously. How are these not the same phone plus they've kept a lot of the design cues from previous one plus phones from the three and the three t with you know the alert slider, of course in the courts on the bottom in USB type-c. It'S kind of like a Frankenstein smartphone design pulling parts from a bunch of different places, but then again, how much do you actually look at the back of your phone? I mean honestly, it actually has to feel good more than it has to look good, and this one does it's seven and a half millimeters thin. It'S got all these rounded sides, it's all metal, but you don't have to look at it as much as you have to feel it, and the one plus five is a good feeling phone. They kept that alert slider, which I like and always got used to pretty quickly and, of course, they kept the fingerprint reader up at the front. The same like last year in the year before same size, same position also the design is kind of limited, because the only colors you can actually get this phone in are literally black and almost black, which I love matte black, that's great. But obviously, if you want some variety, you can grab a skin I'll link to these below it's a deep brand skin and that's easily my favorite way to add color to it without adding the bulk of a case. I highly recommend them, so this does mean you're, not getting the big bezel. This displays that a lot of phones have been moving too this year and that we expected of the new iPhone and the new pixel etc. We still have some pretty thin side bezels here, but it's definitely not quite the same effect. I actually found it interesting that in the Verge's exclusive video of like the making of this phone that they dropped yesterday, they actually admitted like they would have liked to have done something like an infinity display or a bezel the screen, but they just don't have the Tech to do it, that's another disadvantage of being a small company. Now the dual camera system, on the back before we even get to photo quality, is already pretty interesting. First of all, it's it's the headlining new feature. It'S on the box right twice, so it's clearly what they want you to focus on no pun intended, but it is a 16 megapixel, F, 1.7 primary camera with electronic image stabilization and then a 20 megapixel, F, 2.6 telephoto camera as a secondary on paper. That looks pretty good and then, when you open up the new camera app you'll notice, it is a blatant copy of the iPhone camera. App. No doubt about that. The 1 X 2 2 X button for switching between the lenses is their settings in the strip. On the Left, shutter button on the right, it's pretty basic and then the slider, of course, between the One X and the 2 X when zooming in it's definitely a copy here, and no one can really deny that here's the thing I've always said. I don't really mind if you copy stuff, but if you're gon na copy something copy, the good stuff. So if you're gon na copy the iPhone one of the best and most popular phones out, there, then yeah sure copy the camera copy. The fingerprint reader don't copy. The bad stuff don't copy like Siri or something thanks B, so this 1 X, 2 2 X button and the slider and everything in the camera it's kind of the best way to do it, so I don't mind not being a copy at all. So how are the photos well, they're, pretty good, there's, no doubt that the sensor is capable of some pretty great clean photos again. I wish it had optical image stabilization, but essentially this camera is a hit or miss experience. I'Ve been taking photos with this camera for more than a week now and in just like everyday scenarios, and a lot of them turn out really nice. Some of them, though, you'll notice turn out a little weird dynamic range is pretty much always great. Snapdragon 835 can handle taking multiple exposures at the same time. So you'd expect it to be great, and detail is pretty much always on point. The center of the frame and whatever's in focus is always sharp. Colors and image processing were pretty average. I feel like nothing was pushed too far in contrast or saturation, except maybe either Reds a little bit, because sometimes they got oversaturated, but otherwise it's pretty subjective, whether you like the look of a photo or not. I think objectively it'll score high on camera benchmark tests, because it's very fast, very sharp and has huge, dynamic range, but side-by-side with the same shot from pixel or an iPhone. It could be a toss-up which is quite good for a phone at this price and then there's the portrait mode from the secondary telephoto camera honestly. Overall, this wasn't any better than the same attempts from the iPhone 7 plus, but also not worse, kind of struggles with complex edges, but for the most part it does a good job, blurring backgrounds. Obviously it does a much better job on humans than it does on less predictable, less portrait subjects, and it still has some weird halo effects near the edges, but just overall it doesn't quite match having a naturally shallow depth of field. Obviously so, if you're into it, you can use it, I think it'll get better with time with software updates like apples has. You know apples was awful when it first came out and was in beta, but it's learned and it's gotten better over time with portraits, and I think this one will too but right now, it's right in line with what we've already seen so nothing's super new here. So you might be wondering why this secondary telephoto sensor with the worst aperture, gets the 20 megapixel sensor, while the primary gets the 16 megapixel, but their logic, for that is pretty simple. It'S that when you're doing all that zooming and you go way zoomed in you're using all the data from the telephoto sensor, so you want it to be a resolution, so makes sense. So beyond the design and the camera and the specs a couple more minor things are new and a lot of the rest is the same stuff we've seen from previous one-plus phones, it's great stuff, but it's the same stuff. So battery here is 3300 milliamp hours. So not bigger, it's actually 100 million powers smaller than the 3t, but the battery life is about the same. Alas, comfortably all day, thanks to the chip and the display and that display that 1080p AMOLED display. This is probably the thing that's gon na get looked at as the biggest downside of a phone when you compare it to the more expensive flagships, but those are all the phones that enthusiasts are also considering buying. So you kind of have to note those all have 1440p displays or higher. So it's really easy to say. Oh, this is 1080p. It must be awful, but I'd always challenge those people to really look at the display and tell if it really does look that much worse. I mean when I first got. It first took it out the box when it was brand new, didn't even look at the spec sheet and try to just look at it and tell if I could see if it's a 1080p display or did they finally move to 1440p. And it took me more than just a glance, so it's a pretty good display gets bright enough, has pitch-black blacks from being an AMOLED, etc is good, and then, of course, that 1080p display also means performance is a plus Snapdragon 835, with the audrina, 540 and 8 Gigs of ram, of course, all pushing near stock Android on a 1080p display it better, not hiccup. This thing flies through Android and that's its biggest asset. I think super smooth performance tons of apps stay in memory for a long time haven't, had any memory leak issues and that's credit to oneplus, keeping the same software philosophy again near stock Android, with a couple of improvements. No skin really, no big overlay. Just a couple. Tweaks thrown in here and there in the settings that they believe will improve the experience. So you can do things like switch between the off screen or on-screen buttons again with 1 5, you can still mess with the shelf to the left of the home screen by adding widgets to it or messing with the built-in widgets that oneplus includes or you can Disable it completely your call, there's also now a gaming do not disturb mode which halts all banner notifications from popping up when certain apps like games are open. The camera app now has a pro mode which lets you go full-on with manual mode for everything. You know a per sure, focus distance, white balance, ISO etc, and it shoots raw and it even has the level and a live histogram for exposure. The extended screenshot mode is pretty cool, you start the extended screenshot mode and it literally starts scrolling infinitely until you tell it to stop and then that's where the screenshot ends. It'S pretty intuitive and it's just kind of fun to watch it's well done. Charging is still awesome, so if you're a super heavy user - and you get through this whole thing in a day, it recharges as fast as any other smartphone out there. Bluetooth 5.0 is onboard. Nfc is not skipped this time. The vibration motor is a lot stronger and louder and more noticeable, so if you're into that, that's important and the microphones are also improved now too so for recording video and super loud environments. These will do better. So is the oneplus 5 worth your money? Well, if you can get over the design, if you're not one of those people who just wants to say it looks like an iPhone, if you can get over that then yeah. This is definitely a great phone. There'S not a whole lot that you can get with a snapdragon 835 and eight gigs of ram and near stock android. So if you can get over the design and not having an infinity display, I think this is gon na, be a great phone for the money and I'll give it a thumbs up, don't get one. If you can, I think you'll enjoy it. That'S pretty much it. Thank you for watching I'll talk to you as the next one bass. """
nNlTNE1y9DM,Samsung Galaxy S8 Review: The Ultimate Smartphone?,12:22,"Hey what is up guys, MTB HD here and a couple years ago, in 2014, Samsung made a surprise product announcement called the Galaxy Note edge with this crazy display hanging off one side and for a random, unexpected phone. It got a lot of attention since then that product has evolved again and again into Samsung's entire flagship lineup, which brings us to the galaxy s 8. So this new phone looks awesome and that's as hallmark headlining feature is how good it looks and how well it's designed and then, of course, being a flagship. It has all the bleeding-edge specs inside and the hardware you'd expect from a premium Android phone. So is this? The complete package, like the ultimate smartphone, almost it's - almost it's almost there. So let me start by saying I love this phone's build like pretty much everything about the outside of this phone is premium and well-built and awesome the display up front sort of melts over both sides, and it does so smoothly into the back frame. While last year's phone did it more sharply, and if you want to talk about modern or about the future of smart phone design, this year has been a shift to these really tall displays. Making these slightly taller candy bar shaped phones. Now the best part of these super thin bezels on all sides is that the footprint of the phone shrinks a lot. So the five point eight inch and 6.2 inch display is respectively on the s8 and si plus don't feel like huge phones, even though they have huge screens. In fact, the SI, I think, is a great size because it's so narrow I might have big hands, but I think even anyone with regular hands can reach across to the other side of this display, just maybe not all the way up to the top. I think the best indicator for this is the fingerprint sensor. Obviously, there's no more room to put it up at the front of the phone, so they moved it around to the back, but instead of putting it somewhere in the middle of the back, they put it right up there next to the camera. Now, with most back fingerprint sensors they're a little lower on the phone for reach ability, just the way you hold the phone makes it easier. Now I think the top fingerprint sensor might look a little bit better in some cases, but it is definitely harder to reach even with my larger hands. I legit dislike this location. I hold the phone with my right hand, so I'm reaching the maximum distance up and over across the phone over across the camera. With my finger and often I don't quite make it or I touch the hammer glass instead or I only partially cover the fingerprint sensor and the reader doesn't unlock, it doesn't work. So this is through a week of using the phone. I'M sure I could get used to it eventually, but for most people this just makes it a two-handed phone and then you can end up just using the phone with two hands all the time now to be fair, the glass over the camera actually does a good Job deflecting smudges that come from errant finger print unlocks, but honestly a clever way to get past. This is with a case or better, yet a skin actually. So this is the skin from D brand, and not only is it better for gripping this all glass phone, but the tiny depth difference actually lets. You better distinguish the fingerprint sensor from the camera on the back, so fun fact highly recommended either way. Samsung'S word on this is now they provide you with a bunch of other ways to unlock your phone biometrically that don't use a fingerprint sensor, mainly being the iris scanner and the face unlock. Now. I didn't expect to like this answer, mainly because the face unlock can literally be tricked with a picture of you. So that's no good and the iris scanner usually requires you holding it up at a weird angle that you don't normally hold your phone, which is a little awkward, but this iris scanner. I think it might have a wider angle lens, or the sensor has improved something about. It is better because I don't quite have to hold it up at that awkward angle anymore, and it does a pretty good job of unlocking my phone when I'm not like trying to I set it up. I didn't expect to use it, but a lot of times. I just hold the phone up and start using it and it would unlock for me so that actually turned out to be a pleasant surprise, either way. Aside from the awkward tallness of the phone and the fingerprint sensor, the galaxy estate is the best industrial design of any smartphone and a long time. In my opinion, even though there are other phones out now and coming soon that do the tall display thin bezels thing, you still got ta add on all metal and glass still has expandable storage through a micro SD card slot still fully water and dust resistant ip68. Certified so you can spill water on it and it's cool that still has USB type-c with quick charge. Still has wireless charging still keeps the headphone jack and the speaker is below average and downward facing it might be the worst part of the phone's build, but that comes with the territory when there's no room on the front and you kind of want to WaterSeal your Phone so back to the screen. It'S incredible it is, I would say, the best display on any smartphone again it gets extremely bright, so it's visible outdoors or whenever and it's an OLED. So, of course, it has fantastic color and con ratios and dynamic range, and it's super high resolution too we're talking 20 960 by 1440 on both phones. Actually. So all that makes for an awesome media experience, a great web browsing experience and great scrolling through Twitter and Instagram and seeing a lot of stuff at once. Experience and all of Samsung's software obviously supports it perfectly now. Not every app in the App Store fills the display right now right out. The box, like a lot of games, especially, will have to be updated or may just never fully support that so you'll either have the black bars on either side or you can punch in and of course, most videos also aren't in this aspect ratio either. So when watching a video you'll get the black bars as well, unless you hit the button in the software to punch in a little bit, but then you lose some of the frame. So it's kind of your call. It'S give a little take a little for the slightly taller display, but overall I'll take it. I think the screen is awesome and with its curved edges and curved corners, I'm a fan, and then there is the inside of the phone. And since this is a flagship, Samsung is again pushing things to the highest end of what's available, except for one particular area. But there's some pretty high-end specs in here: Snapdragon 835 Adreno, 540, GPU, 4 gigabytes of RAM at least 64 gigs of storage, which, like we said, is expandable, and this is the first phone to ship with bluetooth 5.0, which I made an entire separate video about that. Just dropped highly recommend that so the performance aspect is pretty much taken care of the same way. It always is great specs, great speed and animations out the box, but nobody has used this phone for a year or two yet so we'll have to see how the Samsung software ages and that's just what it is. It'S Samsung software on top of Android 7.0, and it has its pros and cons actually like that. It'S adapted to be more like nougat, with the swiping app drawer and the cleaner overall look, especially of the Settings app. But it's really obviously still Samsung eyes with all the colors and some interesting quirks here and there with the paginate adapt drawer and the couple extra animations, nothing too crazy or extra, but it's not necessarily better than not having it. The edge screen has gotten better. There'S now a couple features like from the note with smart select and the jiff maker, where you can select part of your screen to make an animation or even take round screen shots all kinds of stuff that we didn't have before. So you know there's interesting stuff. You can put in there. I really like the extended screenshot feature where you can take a screenshot, but then it gives you the option to scroll down and extend that as much as you want. So I'm really glad that made its way back into this phone, but yeah. Overall, it's familiar to anyone. Who'S used the Samsung phone in the last two or three years, both aesthetically and functionally. Now, one of the biggest new features in the software Department of the Galaxy s8 is called Bixby. You may have heard of it. It'S the virtual assistant, that's built for this phone. That just does a lot of what Google assistant does now. The circumstances surrounding it are interesting because Samsung put a dedicated button on the side of the phone just for launching it a Bixby button. Now a lot of people didn't like this for fair reason, whether they didn't like Bixby or didn't want it. So they found a way to use an app to remap the Bixby button to do whatever they want, probably should have been in the Samsung settings. In the first place, you can make it the default for the button sure, but in in regions where people don't use, Bixby or Bixby is not supported or a language supports, not there yet or it's incomplete. Let them go in the settings and remap it to whatever they want. It could be a legitimate, useful, separate feature well yesterday, Samsung actually patched that up and blocked any remapping of that button at all on the Galaxy S 8. So it's definitely now just a Bixby bus. So, understandably again people got kind of angry about that. Nobody wants accidental triggers of the app they want to never use, but a couple of people were asking: well hey what, if what if Bixby is actually really great? What? If Bixby is amazing, what, if it's better than Google, so I gave it that chance. I didn't remap my Bixby button and I was using Bixby alongside this phone for the past week and I'll give you that so, first of all, the voice feature is not activated. Yet and it won't get added till later this year, so that's a pretty rough start, but aside from that, it does show you some cards, your gallery, your upcoming calendar events, maybe some weather or some frequent contacts, but then that pretty quickly devolved into a bunch of Samsung apps, like themes and wallpapers and Flipboard and a bunch of stuff - I don't use so really it's working in catch-up mode to be able to do all that Google does with Gmail and navigation cards and flight status, and all that now the one place that did Use some interesting stuff is in the camera app in the viewfinder. There'S a big spate button that if you press it it can recognize images in the viewfinder and search for them, whether it's images or if it's a product, it will get you Amazon, search to maybe buy it. I'Ve seen Google Goggles try this a couple years ago and with Bixby it was about the same pretty hit-or-miss. Sometimes they would get it and it'll be pretty useful, especially when there's a lot of text to it that it can recognize it just searches that text. So it makes sense that it would work there other times when I thought it might get it. Nothing came up or it got it wrong with this Bluetooth speaker for example. Sometimes I got nothing. Sometimes it thought it was a baseball hat. I don't know not sure how to get it to work better, but no dice. So aside from this biggest new software feature being kind of a swing and a Miss on this phone, I'm totally fine with the software on the s8, it's cleaner, it's much more refined. It'S out of the way I like it now the camera on the back. This has also been a bit of a source of discussion at first, it wasn't really talked about and we kind of assumed it was literally the exact same camera as last year. It has the same specs, no dual cameras like some of its rivals: it's a 12 megapixel, f, 1.7 aperture, dual pixel autofocus optical image, stabilization top-notch stuff again, but yeah same as we've already seen but turns out. This is a slightly updated sensor with newer optics. So the images will look slightly different from the galaxy s7. Honestly, most of the difference will come from better image processing, but the photos and 4k videos from galaxy s 8. Look fantastic, as you would expect. Maybe leave a comment if you want a direct comparison to its predecessor, but you can imagine you can see the samples great detail. Great contrast, color and sharpness are excellent and pretty aggressive, auto HDR modes, so dynamic range is also pretty wide. Rarely blows out the highlights like a lot of other phones, woods. So, of course, it's a pleasure to take photos and videos with such a nice screen as a viewfinder, we often say the best camera is the one you have with you. I think this is no exception. With this phone it'll be one of the best cameras you can put in your pocket again this year now, battery life is one area where I would have wanted just a little bit more now. This is Samsung we're talking about here, and they just had one of their phones last year literally start exploding when they tried to push the battery to the limit. So I almost can't blame them for playing it safe this year, but yeah the 3000 milliamp hour battery on the Galaxy s8. I was testing pretty much barely got me through the end of the day. Maybe 10 % left when I'm done and to be fair, I'm pretty heavy on it. I use it a lot bright screen lots of video watching taking pictures etc for the review, but there are phones with definitely better battery life, as I suspected. The upside, though, is that it charges ridiculously fast. I had a night where I went to sleep with 22 % and I woke up in the morning with 8 %. So that's pretty terrible standby time and I was gon na start the day with the battery dead. But I threw it on the charger for about an hour left with a hundred percent battery no problem. So you kind of pick your battles there Samsung just played it safe with the battery. So, at the end of the day, the Galaxy s8 is awesome and it's so Samsung that this this project was born from the crazy, like backburner pet project, that was the Galaxy Note edge and now every phone like this has this crazy edge display and I'm glad They keep doing that stuff and you got to give Samsung credit for making a phone that can stand out for how good it looks in an era. Well, this little mini era where so many phones are accused of all looking the same, this one actually does stand out in a pretty awesome way, and I, like that, a lot about it. There may be little things you don't like about it. Little unmapped buttons little software quirks here and there, maybe the speaker is not the best but as a complete package. This is an awesome phone. I recommend it. I'Ve said the word awesome so many times. You probably can understand that I like this already and I'd, recommend it I'll have links below for other stuff. You want to check out, but that's pretty much it. Thank you for watching toss. You guys the next one peace """
Nq2Kum-eG8g,HTC U Ultra Rant: Skip this One!,6:50,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm cabby HD here - and this is the brand new HTC? U ultra, and it is definitely the shiniest phone of all time and the tablets also be HTC's first big smartphone of 2017 and coming to the US with a price tag of $ 749. So this is definitely a high-end supply, ship, smartphone and people who buy seven hundred dollar Android smartphones. These are the pickiest of the bunch that is the biggest enthusiast people who want the biggest baddest phone they can possibly get. So this seems to be what HTC is setting the tone with those people with so it's rockin, pretty high-end specs, the Snapdragon 820 won three Juno 530 GPU, four gigs of RAM and quality materials. All around I mean you haven't seen. Many phones like this. That are basically a mirror finish on the back: it's glass and metal. It'S got the HTC skin over Android 7.0. Some sweet colors are available, and the cherry on top is, of course, how great this thing looks. So this thing might be a sleeper of a great phone, but the more I look into it, the more I use this thing, the more I understand, the? U ultra the more I realize this seems to be a really poor use of space. This is a big phone, I mean you look at its footprint compared to things like the iPhone 7 plus the Galaxy Note 7, and even the pixel XL, which stands for extra large and it's bigger than all of those and even others with even smaller displays. It'S bigger than all of them, and it's still eight millimeters thick. So it's also definitely not trying to be a super thin phone in any way either. So it seems like there should be all the room in the world to throw in every possible flagship feature and perk right. We'Ve probably already realized this, even if it's in your head without me, saying it, the back of this phone definitely resembles another certain rivals, flagship, not the galaxy s7, the galaxy s6 back when there is a big ol hump on the back for the camera. On the galaxy s6, that's when it looked the most likely you ultra, but of course, the next year Samsung made the phone a little bit thicker, with all its new upgrades and bigger battery, etc and ended up with a much smaller camera hump on the back. There should be no need for such a big hump on an even bigger phone of the. U ultra, so the bump, in an already huge phone to me, seems like a poor use of space and for the record just having a camera bump. Isn'T always a big deal, but on the you ultra it is and then there's a headphone jack or the lack of a headphone jack ya, know headphone jack at all in this huge phone. Now I understand USB type-c is great and it's the future and everything, but Apple's main reason for getting rid of the headphone jack in the iPhone. Besides, courage was to save precious space in such a compact interior of a phone. Other manufacturers have sense continued putting headphone jacks on their phones because they don't need that space and the Portland quite here yet an HTC you definitely could have also. But you didn't, for some reason, seems like a poor user space and then the battery the HTC. U ultra has a 3000 milliamp hour battery, which doesn't seem that bad, but for context yes, something's a little bit off here. You would think that a phone this huge and this thick with this much internal space would have all the room in the world for maybe a two day battery life, maybe the biggest non removable battery, they could possibly sit. But that was a missed opportunity here, and this phone is stuck with average battery life at best seems like a poor use of space, and even if I get a little picky these, these buttons down here at the bottom of the phone have some pretty small touch Targets - and I can't help but think that something just looks a little bit off about them, a bit out of place to the point where it took me a little bit of time to actually get used to pressing in the right spot. With a screen and a phone, this huge HTC could have easily gone with on-screen customizable software buttons, or at least given that option somewhere in the menu is 2017, but they didn't. Instead, they went with the small permanent capacitive buttons way down at the bottom. Now they could, if they wanted to drop that in a software update. So I won't rag too hard on that if they want to enable it, but maybe they just wanted to have buttons on the side flanking a fingerprint reader, because they just really wanted a fingerprint reader, which is cool. You can put one there, but they managed to put one of the smaller ones on any flagship phone. Even on one of the biggest phones out, there seems like a poor use of space. This $ 750 phone is also not water-resistant and with a body and all the internal spaces big, you would think they would be able to find the space to put the seams and the seals to make sure that it's water-resistant, just like a lot of smaller fly. Ships out there, but they didn't seems like a poor use of space and if you look in the sides and the corners of this display, especially up at the top-left corner right underneath the webcam you get some serious light bleed. I hardly ever notice actual light bleed in any flagship smartphone. I don't know if it's, because in this phone the backlighting is too close to the display panel or if the insides are too clumped up there next to the webcam to get that space evenly lit. I don't know what the problem is, but it is actually noticeable and that rarely is a problem for me on smartphones, so seems like a poor use of space. Again, it's also a huge phone with tiny speakers at the bottom sure it's a stereo pair, but it's definitely not the loudest and it's definitely tinny at high volumes. For we have space, you see what I'm getting at. Also most glass back. Phones like this have wireless charging. That'S why they do it. If you have a metal phone, you can't do while I was charging, because wireless charging doesn't work through metal. But if you have this sort of a big glass back and a huge amount of internal space, you would think you could at least have wireless charging, but it doesn't pour you space now, even all that isn't the end of the world. I mean there's phones that are also lacking all of those things I just talked about, but they're also less than this price. So I think at $ 750, in the u.s. it's pretty hard sell. I mean people who are buying phones at that price are looking for something really special and I don't think you're getting that here I mean there are definitely some good promising things about this phone that have me psyched for HTC's next phone. The camera in this guy is really good. It'S a 12 megapixel ultra pixel camera and has phase detection autofocus. That'S really fast and photos look very good. They can almost go toe-to-toe with the Google pixel, so I'm really impressed with that. It also has expandable storage, which is definitely rare in most smartphones and appreciated a high-end flagship and the second display up at the top. While it is a shameless rip of the LG v 20. It'S also kind of useful, sometimes like the one in the LGB 20. You get some app shortcuts up there if you want, I kind of like it when the display is off and I raise to wake, and I just get that little bit of notifications and the time and the date. That'S my favorite feature of the second display, but you know: if you don't want to use it, you can turn it off as well. So there is good stuff here, but aside from new HTC software, there's almost nothing for 750 bucks that this phone does, that you can't get somewhere else better or cheaper. So with that I'll say skip this one and you can pretty easily wait for the HTC 11 to come out pretty soon or just grab a Galaxy s8 when that comes out or an LG, g6 or pretty much any other $ 700 smartphone, which will be a Better use of space than this one, so Bennett hope you enjoyed configured with a comment if you agree, or if you have some other stuff to share thanks for watching talk to you guys, the next one peace """
60OkiR1ujdg,Beats X Review: Best Beats Ever?,5:49,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kip EHD here and so the beats X are brand new. There are now the cheapest wireless beats that you can buy and even cheaper than the earpods now, and they supposedly actually sound better too. So that means they're definitely worth the money right. Well, let's break that down. So the beats X are another new pair of wireless bluetooth buds for 2017, it's 2 in earbuds, connected by a wire with an inline battery and a bunch of little controls and tricks and features that make them work. So in that way, the beats X compare really well to some other wireless audio options, we've gotten recently like the jaybird, x2 and x3 and, of course, the air pods. In fact, I'd say the beats X are pretty much a hybrid exactly in between those two. The beats have a little bit of a different shape and a different functional layout, but obviously they're still pretty recognizable with the logo and everything as beats to anyone looking for them. Now, wireless earbuds have a bunch of different ways of sitting: slash cable management. You know some are retractable. Some have some sort of a wire clip like the Jaybirds. Some have no wires at all. These beats have no cable management at all, except for the magnet in the head of each earbud, which turns out to be just enough. I think the wires a little bit longer, obviously, and it's meant to basically sit on your neck, which isn't too bad and you can barely feel it and then, when you're not listening to them anymore, you can take them out of your ears and basically clip them Together and then that makes this sort of a beats necklace, so I guess, if you thought, beats were out of the fashion game they're totally not, but you still have all the functionality of a normal pair of headphones, which is good. You have the inline control, so your song forward and backward you have the volume up and down a play/pause button and even an inline microphone for using phone calls. But since it's now, 2017 they're also now completely wireless and also use Apple's new super low powered. Super awesome, w1 chip so same thing as the air pods you power them on, and your iPhone immediately recognizes them and pairs them to that and every other Apple device you have, but also, unlike the air pods, you can connect these to an Android phone via bluetooth. No problem and they keep all of their functionality. You can connect air pods to an Android phone if you want, but if you do, you lose like all the cool features and functions like you lose the play/pause. When you take it out, you you lose Siri, you lose volume control it just like a very basic headset at that point. But if you connect beats X to an Android phone, you still have the physical inline controls here. So you still have volume. You still have a microphone, it all still works, so inline controls are good, but there are some downsides of these headphones, too durability wise. These aren't sweat, proof or water resistant at all like in anyway. Now I haven't had any problems with mine and I haven't heard about any problems yet, but it's kind of weird that they're lacking even those basic protection, pretty much just don't take these out in the rain or if you workout and you sweat a lot, then you Can'T use these for working out either, which it wasn't that kind of the point of wireless headphones like this. It seems like a glaring omission, but people smarter than me will tell you that that's just so beats can point you towards another pair of headphones. They sell just for working out so okay, if you're not using them for working out, then you're. Just you know: you're walking the dog walking to class just very casual use around. How do they do with that? Well, first of all, they sound pretty decent. They sound like a lot of other premium, Bluetooth earbuds, which isn't a super high bar to clear, but they're, not garbage at all. They definitely are a lot heavier and on the base, your side for sure their beats, but that's fine for a lot of people. Volume is good and they manage to make a really good seal in my ear, even better than the jaybird X 3s, thanks to the wing tip, so the seal makes the noise isolation that it creates really really good, at least with my ear shape. It'S excellent. I know some people can just like put air pods in their ear and run around no problem. They don't fall out, I'm not one of those people. My ears, don't work with that. So having the wing tip like the X 3s really works well with the beats X stage, my ear seals really well the little wire around your neck line. Your first wearing them is a little annoying at first, especially since they have these little batteries in line as well, but it was really easy to get used to now. I can never quite forget. It was in my ear like the Jaybirds which go around the back of your neck, but beats do still get points for comfort here and then the battery life is pretty solid, you're looking at about six to eight hours tops of charge, but then they also have This awesome, quick charging. If you pick them up and they're dead, you can plug them in for five minutes and add two hours of listening time, which is dope and they charge via this lightning cable. So no dock or pouch or cradle needed, just literally plug them directly. In with the same cable, you charge your iPhone with and you're good to go, so this is obviously further reinforcement that this is made for iPhone users. First, if you're an Android phone person, you have a USB cable, so you need to carry two different chargers, one for headphones, one for your phone, not really meant to do that. It'S made for the iPhone and of course they are portable too. That'S like a big point, so they come with this case that looks like a mouth and you can just crumple them up and shove them in to this case. It'S not very clean. It'S not super elegant. I just ended up shoving them in a sweatshirt pocket or in my backpack, more often than not, but yeah they're definitely still portable. So has 150 bucks. As a total package are the beats X, the best beats ever sure yeah I'd give it that I'd say evany, at least in the bang, for the buck category and the bang for the buck for Beats category yeah. These are pretty good, but that doesn't means you get him like. You got to know. Who-Who beats are made for people who want beats people who worked out with their headphones, who are really active, sweat a lot. Do fitness sports activities they'll want, like sweat, proof headphones. They'Ll find stuff like the j-bird x3 much better, but if you just want like no wires at all, you want totally Wireless, then they'll spring for something like the air pods, but people who want beats can now justify getting. These beats. Thanks for watching talk to you guys in the next one, peace """
5JdHSmaRiP4,LG UltraFine 5K Review: 15 Million Pixels!,7:09,"Hey what is up guys, I'm conveyed to be here and when Apple announced, the new MacBook Pros. They also pretty much killed all hopes for another cinema display when they dropped this alongside it. The new LG 5k ultra fine display, and then they said, they'd be selling. Alongside the new Macs in the Apple store, okay, we want to give it a chance. So is this: if I just cover up the LG logo, is this thing a good enough replacement for the Apple Cinema Display legacy? Is this good enough? Well I'll, be using it for a couple weeks, and my answer is, it depends on who you are. Let me explain so: I'm coming from a pair of aces 32 inch, 4k monitors, I've always been a dual monitor person and this LG 5k display is awesome. I mean it's objectively undeniably awesome. It'S a smaller 27-inch display at 5k, so 50, 120 by 28 80, which gives you about 218 pixels per inch, which is awesome for a desktop display, and it also has the wider p-3 color gamut, so colors really pop and 500 nits of brightness. So it's vivid contrast, II and clear there's a 1201 contrast ratio, so it's just obviously a really great looking panel. That'S what you like to see the expects on the site also say it's anti glare, but the Asus was way more math than this. This is much more glossy, so if you position yourself near Windows, you'll have to know where the lights are going to be behind you, but once you get used to that, that's pretty much fun and then the actual hardware around the monitor itself is pretty good. I mean some people have said it's not the prettiest thing in the world, but you got a height-adjustable stand here. It'S tilted just about one thing it doesn't do is swivel. I think it would have been super easy to put a swivel right here in the base, but it doesn't do that and then you can see the bezels. Obviously some people been talking about how it's not the prettiest thing in the world. I'D agree. It'S got a little bit of a bigger forehead than a chin, but, to be honest, I've barely noticed that, after, like a week of using the monitors, you're not really looking at the bezels anymore after like a couple of days, but the larger top bezel does also Hold the webcam and microphone which are also actually pretty good, and this guy also has speakers right on the bottom, the grills on the bottom they're downward-facing, big, sound, just like the IMAX speakers, is pretty comparable to that the overall still pretty. Well, I mean it's not metal, like you see the exposed metal on the iMac you get metal down here on the stand, but once you get into the plastic of the tops, it doesn't quite feel the same, but you're not really paying that much attention to that. One that you look so good the rest can be kind of forgiven, so the other thing is this monitor is also made for Mac they're selling, alongside the Macs it's marketed next to the MacBook Pro. What does that mean for it? Well, first of all, there are no buttons anywhere on the outside of this thing: there's no knobs or anything for turning on or off no power button. Nothing. It all goes through the software in Mac, OS 10. So any colors! You want to change any resolution. You want to adjust any brightness changes. They will all happen through the software just because that's the way it works with Mac. So there's that and then of course there is the USB type-c, the one single Thunderbolt three table that I'm plugging this into my macbook pro with that's a pretty big deal. So through this one, cable you're getting video going from the computer to the monitor and you're. Also getting power going back from the monitor to the computer, so it's actually charging my macbook pro with the same cable. That'S doing this video, which is pretty awesome. It saves you, a port, you don't have to plug into the wall anymore. For the most part, that's really convenient and then around the back, there's a three port USB type-c hub on back the monitor, it's not full Thunderbolt 3 and it's not even fully powered USB 3.1. But it's a couple of solid USB 3 ports for stuff, like media card readers, webcams, etc, and this again freeze-up ports on the laptop, if you'd normally put say an SD card reader in this laptop, you can now put it on the back of the monitor. So, overall it seems like an ideal package. You know it's one laptop one display one cable between them, nice and clean, and you get way more working area in this glorious 5 klg panel, looking good, but obviously it's not quite perfect for everyone. If you're a person who doesn't have a 2016-2017 MacBook Pro, then this is probably not a good pick, because even with the right adapter, the highest resolution you can get out of this monitor even with a Mac Pro is about 4k with one cable so not ideal. It'S still going to be a beautiful, colorful, contrasting monitor, but it's only 4k and you'd bought a 5k display. You might as well get your money's worth and then number two. If you edit, video on your laptop, which again not a lot of people, do, but if you're in that category, you might not be able to get away with using just the power cable from the monitor, here's a fun story. I tweeted about already when I was editing video in Final Cut Pro with this MacBook Pro plugged in to the monitor getting battery. It says it's charging the whole time and while I'm editing, the battery life still decreases from 100 % going down, while it's still plugged in so I'm plugged in and charging, and I get to 85 percent and 75 percent and 50 percent. I get all the way to rendering the whole video out and right when the video is done, rendering my laptop says it has 4 percent battery, even though it's still plugged in and charging. Obviously that's not a normal use case. Most people aren't editing heavy high-resolution videos on their MacBook Pros. I get it, but you should know that this monitor is not delivering necessarily the entire 85 watts of power necessary to keep this thing fully charged. It even says 85 watts on the site and when I go into system profiler it says it's getting 85 watts, but Dave 2d tested at any tweeted. I mean that he tested it and II was getting something more like 60 to 62 watts. So again, if you're editing with video you're, probably gon na, have to unplug one of the monitors and plug in the power brick to get your full power again, that's not your normal customer. If your setup is near a router like within two to three feet of a Wi-Fi router, you probably want to temporarily avoid this monitor due to poor shielding, there's been reports of flickering and weird non responsiveness and rebooting of the monitor when it's really close to a Router now I don't have that problem on the way on the other side over there. But if you have a router, that's really close to your setup, probably going to want to avoid that LG says: they're working on updating this version to have improved shielding and they're. Even okay to retrofit these monitors that don't have good shielding with new ones, but until then I just give it a second, because that doesn't seem like a very good property to have, but even after all of that, other than that. The monitor the monitor right here is really good. It'S amazing. I wish I could say it's like an Apple logo, away from being like the next cinema display, but obviously it's not quite there. My setup where I'm using is, I have two of these attached to the macbook pro that I'm using all three screens full-time and even I've had little blinking problems that a reboot eventually fixed. But it's like, I shouldn't, even be having this problem. So I think if you have a MacBook Pro a new MacBook Pro - and you just want one monitor to plug in with one cable, to sell your desk and just get way more real estate, then this is an awesome pick. The panel is amazing. It'S way more pixels, it looks fantastic and it is excellent for people who are in that sort of a casual user. Even though you're buying a MacBook Pro, you can still get a lot casually out of this monitor. If you fit into any of those buckets of people I described earlier, then you may want to hold off on this or maybe look at the 4k version. Okay. Overall conclusion is: the panel obviously is really good. It'S beautiful, vivid, vibrant love. It the hardware surround the panel, is sort of hit or miss for some people. It'S alright. You know I like the understated design, but some people might not like it as much and then the compatibility or just knowing if you fit in those buckets of people I talked about, is what's going to decide. If you buy this monitor or not. So that's pretty much it it's! You could say it's ultra fine, thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys. The next one pace. """
srj-NLj4Kt0,iPhone 7 Review: 4 Months Later!,9:01,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm cabby HD here - and this is the newest iPhone it's a couple months later, and this is the review so believe it or not. This phone is about four months old already, which means a lot of you considering buying. One have already made up your mind on that, but you definitely learn a lot from using a phone for a longer period of time for months. Isn'T even that long? It'S just longer than I usually take your view things, but for me at least you know with four months. You know this is the honeymoon period is over. It'S not brand new and shiny anymore got your fingerprints on you got your scratches on it. You'Ve used it every day and you really get to know at best. So, first and foremost, even though this is the iPhone 7, even though this is supposed to be the bigger step forward in the tick-tock of Apple releases, 6, 6 s 7, 7 s. This is still definitely a very familiar and very incremental upgrade to the previous iPhone again. It'S a familiar iPhone same rectangle with the rounded corners for the design, same big forehead and chin with the home button; same seamless, unibody, metal, industrial design again and same scrolling pages of icons for iOS, so at its core. It'S super easy to get used to, especially when you're coming from another iPhone just to pick up an iPhone 7. But that being said, there are plenty of little things and plenty of refinements that all add up to make a much better phone than you had last year. So on the outside, the improvements are more minor. You know a little design tweak from last year. The antenna bands are gone and the back looks a little bit cleaner, but it's definitely still an iPhone. There'S no mistaking that. So if you want to mess with the design a little bit more, you can maybe put a skin on it. Like I showed in my daily driver video, but this design, as still as it may seem, is iconic and very familiar, so we still have some of the biggest bezels in any smartphone. That is a bit annoying when you have the white bezels, but that's so you can still have this home button for at least one more year and speaking of the home button. It'S now not a physical button anymore, but it's more of like a force touch trackpad. It doesn't actually move it's just a still piece of glass, but it's pressure-sensitive. So when you press it, it works and the taptic motor makes a click and it makes it feel like you're, pressing a button and it really convincing I'd, say it's really easy to get used to. It used to be weird when you're like pushing on a table, and you know it doesn't really work with gloves, but I'm a hundred percent used to it now, I'm actually totally cool with this home button. I should also mention, I think touch ID is at the holy grail, where it's like a no-brainer, whether you should use it or not. You set it up once right when you get your phone and it's faster and more secure than typing in a password. Every single time, so I like touch ID a lot anyway, aside from just the home button. This is the second generation of the iPhone with 3d touch, but I don't really use it that much I mean it's definitely built into more apps and there's shortcuts on the home screens and even in the apps themselves, but yeah. I just don't really use it. That much one thing I do have to say, though, is something the iPhone doesn't get enough. Credit for the iPhone has the best vibration motor in any smartphone period, and I'm talking about the taptic engine like this phone literally feels like it's tapping you on the wrist or in your pocket or in your hand, when you get a notification, it's awesome. So I love the taptic engine. It'S really good and Apple. Clearly knows this because they're using it in way more parts of iOS animations now so like the notification shade bouncing off the bottom of the screen, that type of thing or control center bouncing up or really just any bouncing anywhere in iOS, it always clicks. So the phone feels like it's bouncing anyway. One of the biggest changes on the outside is it's now officially a waterproof phone, so the iPhone 7 is ip67 rated, which means you don't have to worry about, dropping it in or near water anymore, and you can just take underwater photos and videos if you want. Basically, the phone should survive water exposure now, but other than that you know, the displays on the iPhone 7 are still pretty good. You know nothing crazy or amazing. It still has great color reproduction, but the one thing that's killing me. It'S not just me. It'S tons of people, obviously about the outside of the phone, is the lack of a headphone jack. Basically, Apple is clearly aiming for an entirely port'less Wireless iPhone in their future, so in that process, they're removing the headphone jack and starting to push wireless audio super aggressive. Yes, super forward-thinking, yes, super a pain in the ass. Also, yes, I mean, I think it's I'm probably gon na make a whole video on the whole wireless phone thing. Maybe let me know if you'd want that in the comment section now, the camera on the iPhone 7 is new. You can see the different housing there's new sensor and new glass, and you might remember from the smartphone Awards. This camera is already one of the best. It takes great photos and great 4k videos. I think it might get the title of best. Low-Light photo camera back, it was kind of close to Samsung, but the image processing from Apple has always been excellent. Autofocus is also extremely fast and daytime photos. Look pretty damn good too, but it's by far the best video camera in any smartphone I'll. Tell you that right now I'll link below the video I shot entirely on this camera, but seriously the 4k video from the sensor with the optical image stabilization and the big wide open aperture honestly, sometimes you can't tell the difference from like a real, dedicated mirrorless cameras. Footage it's that good get a little depth of field going. I mean it's awesome everything's there now the iPhone 7 plus has a second camera lens, as you already saw in my daily driver video one regular camera same as the smaller phone and one telephoto lens at twice the focal length for that two times: optical zoom, and It'S really interesting the way it works, but I think it turned out to be one of Apple's coolest products of 2016 last year. Basically, when you're all the way, zoomed out you're, not just getting data from the main camera, as you would expect, but it's also actually intelligently using some imagery stitching in from the telephoto camera as well to make it a little bit sharper and a little bit more Detailed in the center of the frame now, sometimes it uses lots of that data. Sometimes none at all like if you accidentally cover the telephoto lens with your finger, for example, it doesn't use anything from it, but when you start to zoom in a bit, it continuously intelligently analyzes how much of the information to stitch in and then you can actually See it completely switch over cameras when you get to 2 X zoom, it's subtle, but the tiny changing exposure is there. You can see it and from what I've seen it actively. Does this switching during video recording to so dual cameras is pretty awesome and it works really well, you can only get it obviously on the bigger iPhone, which is why I guess a lot of people don't get to play with it, but through software updates stuff, like Portrait mode is getting better every day, and it's so basically, if you're into photography or videography, the iPhone 7 plus is the again now on the inside. Basically, all you need to know that's changed is the chip. The a10 fusion ship is fantastic in this phone and I'm pretty comfortable calling this the most responsive phone ever like this is something Apple does really well, since they control both all the hardware and all the software. So no phone is as smooth and as one-to-one responsive to the touch of your finger as a fresh iPhone. I'D say the Google pixel comes closest right now and then maybe the 1 plus 3t right after that and generally stock Android phones. But the smoothness and high frame rates of animations are the most consistent on the iPhone 7 and that's something I really like. And it's something you'll appreciate like every single day. You'Re using the phone overall performance is awesome through multitasking in everyday use and gaming and navigation and all kinds of stuff and the battery life to go with. That is also about the same as last year, which is to say pretty good, but not great. So the iPhone 7 has an okay battery and decent standby time, while the bigger iPhone 7, plus that I'd recommend has pretty good battery with excellent standby time. Also fun fact. This year, Apple made the iPhone the same dimensions and included a bigger battery, instead of making it smaller with the same sized battery. Thank You Apple. Keep doing that please! I really don't need it to be thinner, but that is pretty much what's good, with the new iPhone lots of little upsides lots of little improvements with the hardware on the outside and on the inside. My biggest complaints would be that they went with lightning over USB type-c again, although I would totally expect them to keep doing that and that they went with no headphone jack instead of a headphone jack. Obviously I can't tell you how many Eber drivers have offered me. The aux cable and I have to turn down the jams, so, at the end of the day, iPhone 7 has a lot, that's new with it, but obviously it's still a very familiar incremental upgrade just like previous iPhones have been, and that's kind of the point. That'S why people keep getting iPhones? That'S not a bad thing. That'S a great reason to buy this phone again, especially if you're coming from your previous gen, but I think that this year, you're gon na see a lot more big improvements with the 10th generation iPhone or the iPhone 7s or the iPhone X. Whatever they end up. Calling it that's the one I'm most excited for until then, that's been it. Thank you for watching. I thought you guys in the next one peace """
KftNp6hdO5g,Apple AirPods Review: Fully Wireless!,5:23,"[ Applause ] amen, listen to tell us what right now huh what hey! What? No okay, of course, not no hey! What is up guys, I'm Kip EHD here and earpods. Remember these. These are finally apples, air pods. They were introduced alongside the iPhone 7. If you remember, and then there were a bunch of delays, a bunch, more delays and much more but now they're. Finally, here so in case, you forgot, what's actually special about these. Besides, just the fact that they're Wireless is the w1 chip, this is new and if you can get past the fact that they look like a slightly larger version of the Apple earpods with a longer stem and the weird, if you can get past all the jokes, This is what you should actually know about that the w1 chip was introduced for easy pairing of these air pods and anything with that chip to all of your Apple devices, without you having to sign in so as long as you have an Apple ID on your Device so for me, that's my iphone my iPad and even my macbook pro. This will be able to pair with all of them instantly via bluetooth. So this is not the first pair of headphones to come out with this chip. The Apple made beats solo 3 actually had them, and I've demoed them in a previous video, but here's how it works. You open the case that they come in for the first time with the iPhone somewhere near it. This turns it on the iPhone finds the headphones pairs to them and you're connected just like that. With that one button press these air paws are now connected, not just to my iPhone but they're ready to play on any and all of my Apple devices, and I don't have to do this process again. Also, there's a little bit more tech inside these. Besides, just the drivers and the batteries there's an accelerometer and a pair of proximity sensors, you can see the little dots on the outside and these are basically to be able to tell with it's in your ear or not, and there's also a touch sensor on the Back of the earbuds for further controls, all of this means you're gon na have some smart tricks up your sleeve with the air paws, mainly just for convenience, so, first of all, when they're in the case, they're charging and off, if you take them out of the Case they turn on and they connect to everything when you put it in your ear, your audio automatically starts playing use it. The proximity sensor to automatically start playing your music. When you take one of the ear pods out of your ear, it automatically pauses. So it's kind of neat: if one of them falls out or if you take it out, you might be listening in music and you immediately want to just pause it and listen to someone talk. You can just pull it out your ear and all of it stops, and you can hear what people are saying once you put the earbud back in the music starts up playing again, but what's cool is since there's actually no inline controls where you would normally find Them on a wire there are play, pause controls on the side, the earbud itself, so there are touch controls. A single tap on the side of the earbud will activate play pause and you can actually double tap to activate Siri from your iPhone or from your Mac, and it will use the microphone built into the air pause themselves. To listen to you now it's serious, so it has its flaws, but it can be pretty useful, like you can change the volume of what you're listening to by double tapping and asking Siri to turn up the volume or, if you're paired to your iPhone you're walking Outside you can say to navigate somewhere and you'll, hear the directions in your ear and the air pods, which is pretty useful. So that's what you can do right out the box with the air pods as far as audio quality goes they're pretty similar, if not a little bit better than the ear pods, but they're the exact same shape as the ear pods. So if those worked well for your ears, then these will stay yours as well. So it might sound weird to say, but like the wire in between the earbuds of normal wireless earbuds or just regular, headphones is actually like a convenience feature. If one of them falls out your ear, you don't have to go looking for it, because it's attached to the wire it's kind of a strange thing to think of it. That way, but that's kind of what this is teaching us the battery life on these is five hours on a charge which is a little bit less than what I'm used to with the jaybird X threes, which will go around eight hours. But what's really convenient is again that case it's really a big part of using these air pods that cased with the wireless charging you slip it in with the magnets. You snap them into place, and you can add three hours of listening time in just 15 minutes. So that's about half battery and 15 minutes of charging in there and then you can total about 24 additional hours of listening time by putting them in the case all day. So if you commute to work - and you listen to these like an hour each way - you can probably go a whole week without actually charging these. So these things are on sale now and they'll retail for a hundred and fifty nine dollars. But again, if you order them right now, you won't get them to like 2017 they're still delayed. So what I recommend these over a similar pair of wireless earbuds, like my j-bird x3s, no I'd still prefer those. I don't really like these that much, but I like them more than I thought I would and that's a good sign. I think it's because of all the tech inside because of the mics and the proximity sensors in the auto play and pause. That kind of stuff is really cool. So now it's out, I don't know what took so long, but the air pods are finally out. The choice. Is yours, thanks for watching I'll talk to you guys, the next one peace """
DhCJuJoE6wM,Macbook Pro with Touch Bar Review! Worth it?,11:32,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm could be HD here, and this is the 2016 MacBook Pro with touch bar very expensive, but very interesting, laptop kind of fits right in with 2016. So there's plenty of new things about it and plenty that you might not even care about. One of the things is the new Apple logo. On the back that little metal, one doesn't glow anymore. You might not care, but I think I think this was the last glowing Apple logo before they replace that and it's a slightly new aesthetic pretty similar to last year. So again, you might not care, but this is actually a big deal when it comes to the story of this laptop. All of this generations. Macbook Pros are thinner and in a smaller footprint than last year's, and now all in this very boxy sharp shape. Like the edges are literally sharp, I kind of like the aesthetic, even if you don't like this, as like your favorite laptop, you still got to admit that the metal, unibody construction kind of makes all plastic and rubber type laptops feel a lot more cheap. So at least you might feel like you're getting your money's worth when you pick it up and hold it now. I don't know who is asking for a thinner MacBook Pro, but I can say you know as someone who carries it in a backpack all the time. Having it be a little bit lighter is actually kind of nice, but that's pretty much. The only design change on the outside that will differentiate it from last year. Most of the character of this laptop is on the inside. So inside the display is new. The keyboard is new, the trackpad is new, the speakers are pretty much everything's new. The display is great. It may be my favorite part of the whole laptop it gets brighter than before up to about 500 nits, so pretty insane levels of brightness, and I rarely need to max it out even when I'm outside it's the same resolution as before. But it now supports a wider p-3, color gamut. So it's a pretty great looking Retina display the new keyboard moves to the second generation, butterfly switch keys, and these definitely take some getting used to. I originally preferred you know the quieter deeper travel, chiclet style keys from last year's machine again, but after using it for a few weeks, I've gotten super used to these keys and I don't mind it. The lesser travel is still kind of weird, with the arrow keys being all bunched up in the corner, but everything else is fine, and I type just as fast on this as last year now and the trackpad is now huge like. I don't even think you understand. It'S super massive: it's nearly the bottom half of the laptop it's bigger than most smartphones, bigger than most people's whole hands. So on one hand, it's nice to have, because such a huge surface will let you take the mouse from corner to corner without lifting your hand. So I guess it solves that problem, but on the other hand, palm rejection isn't quite as good and there's still times where I touch the trackpad by accident and that kind of gets annoying. So this is definitely something that I haven't completely gotten used to, but I welcome it. The new speakers flanking the keyboard are pretty good, but I think maybe I expected them to be like way better because of how good they were on the little tiny, 12-inch MacBook. But actually that the grille on the sides of the speaker's is actually a bit of an illusion. The speaker itself is only you know: small half inch circle near the bottom, but they still sound very good and get very loud for a laptop and then, of course, above the keyboard. Replacing the previous row of function keys is the new touch bar I'm gon na. Go out on a limb and say it's actually really cool. It'S not the touchscreen laptop that some people wanted. But I don't I've, never really liked touchscreen laptops because it always seems like I'm pressing against the hinge and typing and using that it just doesn't seem natural to me. It'S also a little bit more fatiguing to be up here instead of down here. But that's just that's just me. So what is the touch bar? The touch bar is a 1085 by 30 resolution, OLED touchscreen that sits above the keyboard and displays a customisable group of buttons and controls. Depending on what app you have open. So the two things I would immediately be concerned about our viewing angles and fingerprints viewing angles, because you never really look directly down at the touch bar you're, always looking at it at a sort of an angle and finger prints, because it's a touch screen um. So the viewing angle they actually did a really good job with it's pretty much, never difficult to read. Brightness is great. Clarity is great, and it's a matte finish, so it also does a really good job with fingerprints and speaking of finger prints. All the way to the right of the touch bar is a power button with a touch ID sensor on top. So this is a fingerprint reader. This is awesome. I'Ve gotten super used to doing touch ID purchases and especially logging in when waking up the machine. It makes typing a normal password and seem super inconvenient. So I really really like the fingerprint sensor. So then the rightmost section of the touch bar is a persistent set of keys. That always shows up, so you can kind of memorize their position. This set is customizable through the touch bar settings, so I replace the usual Siri button with a spotlight search, because I use that way more than theory and you can expand it with an arrow to show the entire normal set of function keys. So it also be kind of weird if those are always two taps away, so you can also just touch and drag along those controls with one touch. So it's not extra presses to get to things like brightness and volume. There'S still one tap away like they were when the whole thing was there, but then, with some Apple apps, you get new functionality, new buttons to show up in the middle. So, if you're in an app that doesn't support the touch bar, it's just a big blank space and there are plenty of apps that don't support the touch bar that I'm waiting for an update for, but since Apple has had time to work on it. They'Ve developed their own apps for the MacBook Pro to work with it. So since it's a super wide thing, it sort of works well for like sliders or a timeline, so in QuickTime Player you can quickly and really smoothly scroll through a video you're watching so scrubbing is really neat and in the Photos app, for example, it becomes this Slider for scrolling, through all your pictures or videos in a library and Safari, is definitely where I think it's the best, though so in normal browsing. You have. You know your typical buttons, your back button, your search button for a new URL, your new tabs and then in the middle you get some tabs switching, so you can switch between the open tabs. You have open and preview them a little bit. You can actually see. What'S on the little tabs, but you get the idea now, anytime, you have a video of any kind opened in Safari. The middle of the touch bar turns into a video scrubber, just like in QuickTime. So if you're in a YouTube, video, for example, scrubbing with your finger along the bar, is way more fun than dragging with the mouse. You can even scroll through Instagram videos back and forth, rewinding and everything. I don't think you can do that anywhere else. So it's great in Safari and it's also legitimately useful in Final Cut Pro. So I'm a Final Cut editor and there are some shortcuts that it puts there that are actually useful and really faster than what I would have been doing with the mouse, like the ability to use a single button, touch to add audio fades. The beginning and end of any specific clip, just by touching the bar, is so much nicer than using a mouse, and this is the difference between a gimmick and an actually useful feature. I think like in order to not just be a gimmick. These buttons on the touch bar have to be able to do things that I couldn't already do with like a keyboard shortcut, for example, pros use, keyboard shortcuts, select in Safari, for example, that new tab button. It'S cool that it's there and it makes sense to put it there in Safari, but is taking my hands off the key bored and reaching up and looking for that button actually going to be faster or more convenient than just keeping my hands on the keyboard and Doing command T, probably not so the best thing about the touch bar is when I can quickly do things on it that I couldn't ordinarily do with just the mouse or just the keyboard shortcuts. So, like I said, the quick, audio trimming and final cut is awesome and there's updates coming to Adobe apps like Premiere and After Effects and Photoshop. But again those are incoming updates. So the bottom line is this: is a macbook pro and a pro already knows your apps keyboard shortcuts. So i'm hoping when apps, like Spotify and Chrome and After Effects get updated, that they actually have useful functional stuff in the touch bar. But until then, most of my time as a pro will be spent on the mouse and keyboard, oh and one more thing about the whole pro name in case you haven't already noticed. This laptop only has four ports, headphone jack and then two USB type-c on one side and two USB type-c on the other, so naturally there's a bunch of controversy over this decision, but think of it. This way, USB type-c is the future right like that's. Why we get so hyped for new smartphones to have that port? We want new tablets to have it new devices, etc. Laptops are a little bit more than that, so they take a little while they're a bit down the line. That'S more of the future. These adapters, these these dongles, are like our bridge to the future and they suck now. I know I hate using adapters, they're ugly they're, an extra expense, you lose them, etc, etc. But if we imagine a future where every laptop has these super high-end super high data, throughput high-powered, reversible, badass port, we're gon na have to cross that bridge eventually, now it's one thing to just change the port on a phone. You know if it's USB type-c, you just need a charger. So if you include that type-c charger on the box, the user is set, but if it's a laptop there's a little more that we do with laptops than just charge. Luckily this is Apple. We'Re talking about. So these laptops will be everywhere, they're going to sell they'll be out there, no matter what so, when Apple comes out with their new laptop, and it has a bunch of USB type-c ports in it if you're an accessory maker, it's in your best interest now to Make as many good USB type-c accessories as possible and as good as possible to make the most money so we're starting to see things like really good. Usb type-c mobile SSDs, like this Samsung t3 Drive. I just carrying - and this really good, USB type-c monitor like the LG 5k display. I made a video about that. There'S a new USB type-c read reader and even in USB type-c headphones now, but it's definitely not a hundred percent converted yet so, if there's something you want to keep using, where there's no USB type-c version, you need an adapter and almost nobody is living an entirely Usb type-c life yet like that's definitely in the future, so we're still crossing that bridge. But you know that might be enough of a reason right there and not to buy this generation, and I totally get that. But as someone who's sort of on the bleeding edge of tech alot - and this happens to me a lot - I'm kind of willing to make it work. That being said, the omission of an SD card slot is terabyte, so many cameras, so many pro accessories use SD cards that wouldn't have been that hard um. That'S just kind of my only gripe. I would have also liked to seen maybe a couple more USB type-c boards like I would have been really happy with six also r.i.p MagSafe. It was great while we had anyway at the end of the day, the 2016 MacBook Pro is a different animal, but the same beast. What the [ __ ] does that mean Kobe Bryant? It still has everything sealed in it still has all the RAM and SSDs soldered or glued to the motherboard. It'S still pretty much, not upgradable at all like before. Unfortunately, the battery left on the 13-inch is still pretty good. The battery life on the 50 inch is still not that good. The new chips are great and the SSD performance is godlike, which is great for mobile photo and video editing and anything that requires moving large files around. But overall performance isn't going to shock you. It'S pretty much around inline with the bar set last year. I actually would have expected a little bit better in terms of quality control. Not a lot has happened to my machines, but I've seen especially on Twitter. A lot of things everywhere from just the unresponsive touch bar graphic, showing up on the display something weird like that too, like a full-on graphics meltdown again, none of that has happened to my machines, but it's kind of weird to see it. So often it's kind of strange, but here's the bottom line with this laptop for me - is it worth the price? No, this thing is definitely overpriced for sure. Would I still buy it again yeah I really enjoy. I really like it. I'M not the average person the average person doesn't make the financial decision like this, and I don't think this laptop is a smart financial decision right now. But if you're, looking at a new MacBook Pro, maybe maybe hold out for the 2017 version, with more USB type-c accessories available and just skip over that bridge either way, that is it. Thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace. """
0f_BTRPUr6k,OnePlus 3T Review: T is the new S!,5:36,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm cabby HD here and this this is the one plus 3t and there's just a couple things you need to know about this phone. Obviously it looks very familiar to the phone 1 plus released less than six months ago. The one plus three one of the best budget phones out there for the record great phone for under 400 bucks highly recommended. So the one plus three T is the one plus three as the iPhone 6s was the iPhone 6. Basically T is the new S. It'S kind of an iteration Allah, the phone that came out back in June. It'S a spec bump, fit into the exact same design. You wouldn't know it was new just by looking at it, unless you knew exactly what you're looking for. So here we go I'll, tell you exactly: what's new number one is, you might have noticed is the slightly new color. This is called gunmetal and you can see it versus a one. Plus three is silver. You notice the difference right. It'S subtle! It'S slightly darker, it's kind of more like a Space Gray type of thing. I like it, there's also a soft gold as well number two is it has a Snapdragon 820 one inside at the higher 2.35 gigahertz clock speeds. So not under clocked like it is in the pixel. So this is a slightly newer super high-end chip and when you pair that, back with the same six gigabytes of RAM, you have yourself a pretty high. I mean one of the highest end, spec sheets of any smartphone, so number three, and I think that this is my favorite. Is they fit a much larger battery in this phone in the exact same dimensions? This one 3 T is rocking a 3400 milliamp hour battery up from the 3000 milliamp hour battery you had before that is legit. I'Ve been preaching about. You know if you can make a phone battery as big as possible, even if the phone's a little bit thicker. You should do it so now you're getting a 13 % bigger battery with the 3 T in the same metal body. That should be nice that should translate to much better battery life and screen on time number 4 is. This is also now a 128 gigabyte phone. So double the storage you had with one plus three was a 64 gigabyte phone tops so 100 when ta. That should alleviate some of the concerns of people who really wanted expandable storage. You still don't get that, but I keep my entire spotify library downloaded for flights and twenty eight gigs was great. For me, number five is the cameras, so the one plus 3t has the exact same 16 megapixel camera on the back. That'S no change still pretty. Damn good, but it's now rocking a new 16 megapixel front-facing camera, so a big upgrade from the 8 megapixel selfie camera from the oneplus 3. Obviously you're only going to care about this. If you take a lot of selfies or front-facing video, but for what it's worth, I did notice a difference in the quality of the photos and the videos from the front-facing camera. It did seem to struggle a little bit with focus, sometimes possibly since it's also an F 2.0 aperture. But when you do now focus with this front-facing camera, you can tell the difference and the selfies look really good. From the 1 3 T, nice and wide-angle, decent colors, decent dynamic range again and better sharpness and even a slightly shallower depth of field when your subject is closed and finally number 6. Last but not least, is the software. So you note out of the box. The 3t is running Android marshmallow still, but with their upgraded, very light oxygen OS and that should be upgraded to Android new get very soon and retaining all these features alongside the 1 plus 3, so the 1 plus 3 isn't becoming obsolete. That would just be nuts in half a year, they're still giving that a software upgrade as well, but obviously the higher spec version. This 3t replaces the 3 and has a couple new, looks and features in oxygen OS as well so they're going to be selling this 3t for 439, so again, still really high-end flagship specs for a relatively low price, like the pixel, with the same chip with a Lower clock speed is what 650 bucks to start the galaxy s7 600 bucks. You'Ve looked at all the numbers on paper and in user experience. This is a great phone for another, pretty low price. All the rest of the things I didn't talk about in this video are still exactly the same from the oneplus 3 review, I'll link it below. If you want to watch it again, but it's the same great 1080p display same great size and metal, build and form factor decent speakers. It'S still the fastest charging phone in the world, I'm pretty sure right now, so charging is awesome to have so all those things plus the upgrades and about a $ 40 price hike for six months later, that's pretty good. In my opinion, I'm liking this. It kind of seems like oneplus is picking up sort of where Nexus left off before pixel showed up where people were really excited for a really mid-range to high-end phone that had really lightweight or pier stock Android for a really low price, and the experience would be Awesome well now pixels, like 650 bucks. So if you still want a lightweight Android experience for around half that price 400 bucks, ish, then seems like one plus three T is the way to go. You know how I said the one plus three T is to the three as the 6s is to the six well turns out. Oneplus did this on purpose. They did it for the exact reason. The letter T comes one after s, so like one better than s, kind of one upping Apple in that way, whatever maybe they're trolling but well played one plus three T gets my thumbs up in my nod of approval, and it will probably be right up at The top like the highest end budget, smartphones, you can get the smartphone Awards. 2016 is coming up. If you haven't already noticed, so that's something that we're thinking a lot about either way. That'S been it. People said that one plus three owners should be mad because the phone is obsolete six months later. No, it's not that's still also one of the best budget smartphones of the whole year, but that's pretty much all I have to say about the three T. Let me know what you guys think in the comments section below. Thank you for watching and talk to you guys. The next one peace """
77aeW3bsCzc,Jaybird X3 Review: Best Bluetooth Earbuds 2016!,5:19,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kip EHD here - and this is a quick review of the j-bird x3. The super portable Bluetooth wireless earbuds, connected by a wire unlike the more expensive and also delayed Apple earpods. The X threes are definitely an incremental improvement to the X 2's, which makes sense because it's not like there's smartphones, where there's new features to add every year. So these will be very familiar to those of you who have seen the X 2's or even the original jaybird bluebloods X, which is fine, because those are also both pretty good. So first off the new shape is different. It'S a bit of a new design. If you look at these earbuds they're a bit smaller in volume than last year with the X, 2's and they're, a bit shorter and also a bit lighter, which helps with comfort and the most important part of this back - is that they're now flat on the back. So the X threes are now what I'll call hat proof. So, while the X 2's had a sort of a rounded bulbous back that would stick out of your ears more the X 3 buds stick out a bit less and they don't get caught as easily. So if you have like a winter hat to put on over the top of your earbuds that works better or if you ride like a motorcycle, I needed to go under a helmet. This new design helps a lot with that too, and then the shape of the fins as well, which I do use, are also slightly more curved which helps with the fit, and they were already pretty good at not falling out of my ear. But this helps even more and the sort of passive seagull that it forms over. Your ear is extremely good, even with the rubber tips that I use. But, as you can see, they do come with both the rubber tips in different sizes and the comply foam that molds to your ear and gives you an even better seal there. Also again, this soft touch plastic finish instead of the glossy from the originals which again I'll, take matte black wherever I can get it Plus now, there's a little bit more metal to bolster the build quality. The previous buds were actually pretty durable already, as I've mentioned, and as an athlete I'll take any enhancements to the build. I can get there fully sweat and water resistant again. You can beat them up, take them out on the sand, take them to the track, wherever they can definitely hang now. They technically have new drivers inside a new six millimeter driver with a more of a cone-shaped cylinder housing listening to the x2 and x3 back to back, I can only hear a bit of a difference. I say the biggest difference I heard and sound with the x3 s. Is this slightly wider soundstage like a little better instrument separation which is cool to hear, but overall, the sound profile from the X 3s lows, mids and highs are very similar to the familiar X to s, if not a little bit more detailed. But obviously these can't be audiophile grade comments. I mean I'm not an audiophile, I'm streaming, you know Spotify music or Bluetooth audio from my phone to wireless earbuds, so it's everyday use. They sound great. What you can now do, though, is use the my sound app to change the sound signature with these, so I already think they happen to have one of the best flat sound signatures of any wireless pair of headphones. But now, just like you could, with the freedoms, you can adjust the firmware of the earbud to follow it around from device to device. So you can build your own shape of a sound profile. You can name it and save it or you can pick from a ton of free, pre-built ones or community based ones. All these sound signatures to choose from so that's pretty dope. So the one thing that can be considered either an upside or a downside or both is the new controller and battery instead of being built into the earbud itself. Now the battery is in the controller, so you will still get roughly 8 hours of streaming battery life, which is on the high end of what you can get out of any wireless earbud. But now the charging method is this little cradle thing here with the pins. It works fine, you line up the pins and click it into place and start charging like that. It'S full size USB, so it works pretty much anywhere. The original did, but now the downside here is you can't forget this little charger. Cable. You got to remember to bring this thing on trips if you lose it you're kind of stranded, because you can't just plug the headphones right into a cable like you could before so yeah a bit of a mixed bag here that you now require this little cradle To charge, I guess I consider that the biggest downside and then for what I would consider to be the biggest upside in my opinion, of the new j-bert X, 3s is the price. So when the jaybird X 2's were first launched, they were about 170 $ 9.99. For most places they're pretty premium, but for what you're getting for the price? A plus you've seen a review. I really liked them, then the jaybird freedoms came out and they were $ 1.99. 99. You know a little bit more expensive and they're starting to encroach on some other high-end headphones, so I'm not as likely to recommend that to everyone, but you kind of might have expected the jaybird X 3s to follow suit. Well, they don't. These X threes are launching at 120, 999, that's already a great price for an improvement over the headphones that launched for 180 bucks. So that's dope. Thank You j-bird for that, and then again one of my favorite things about when they launch new headphones is the old ones, go down in price. So now you can get the X 2's for somewhere around 80 bucks, so I'll leave a link to both of those pairs of headphones right below that like button. If you want to check them out and maybe get yourself into some wireless audio for the holiday season, the price, I think, is awesome. I'Ll leave a link to the freedoms as well. I did a full review on them. I don't recommend them as much as I recommend these. I definitely prefer these, but if you're curious I'll leave that too - and that's pretty much it thanks for watching this review and also for those who have been asking and curious. Yes, the Google pixel review and the iphone 7 review are both upcoming. Give me a second that's been it. Thank you for watching I'll talk to you guys, the next one peace """
lV70CxFlx7w,Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Review!,10:37,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here - and this is the Samsung Galaxy - Note 7. It came out a couple weeks ago, but this is everything you need to know about the phone that I've used as my daily driver, since it drops so new points for the Galaxy Note. 7 are the design refresh some camera improvements, a bunch of new software features and explosions? Let'S cover all of that, so the new design is something of a mix between the Galaxy s7 edge and the note 5, so plenty of glass on the front and the back symmetrical on the sides from front to back and curved enough on both edges that it Has what's called a dual edge display, so the glass just kind of sort of melts over onto the sides of the phone to the metal rails? And it's built extremely well honestly between this and the galaxy s7 edge Samsung seems to be on top of the build quality game. As far as smartphones go right now, it turns out to not be that slippery thanks to the metal rails on the side where your fingers rest, you can still drop a dbrand skin on the back to show less fingerprints or add a bit more grip on the Back I'll leave a link to them below, but yeah, I'm overall pretty happy with the build and the finish on the note 7 and the all-black is definitely my favorite look. There is a new blue coral color and it kind of looks pretty neat too a lot of people like it, but I'm a fan of the all-black look on pretty much any smartphone. So the only problem I found with the dual edge display is actually sometimes when I'm holding it. I don't realize that, like part of my hand, is actually still touching the display, so it seems like it's unresponsive at first, but it's just because I'm holding it wrong. So that's my bad, but it's just in the way you hold it as far as, what's inside the note 7, it's pretty much using the highest end parts available, so Snapdragon, 820, 4 gigabytes of RAM and up front still an incredible quad HD Super AMOLED display and Let me just say this is still what Samsung is doing best in the business right now. Other phones are getting better technology in their displays and there are some other great looking smart phone displays right now, but none of them match this. In my opinion, the vividness in the brightness in the sharpness and color - it just looks great it's one of those phones where I would never have to worry about being able to see it even outdoors, even when it's like sunny in the car in a bright area. When brightness goes all the way up on auto-brightness in a well-lit area, it really pushes the brightness, so I can always see the screen even when I'm navigating or something like that, it's awesome. So this is hands-down the best display in a smartphone and another thing: that's best-in-class on the note 7 is the camera. So it's brought up from the galaxy s7 and s7 edge. It'S actually the exact same camera from those phones, so the 12 megapixel sensor and f 1.7 aperture with optical image. Stabilization all of thats come up and when it first came out, I would say it's absolutely the best camera in any smartphone. Now iPhone 7s come out since then, and it gets pretty close. It has some other novel features that make it unique, but still as an all-around camera. This is a huge selling point. I have a ton more photos from this camera since I've gotten it and it's kind of because it's one of those cameras that encourages me to take a lot of photos, autofocus and actually opening the camera app and snapping a photo are super quick. So it just feels easy to take lots of photos and take lots of great photos, and this is basically a continuation from how good it was in the galaxy s7. As you can see, great colors, great dynamic range for a smartphone camera and excellent sharpness in detail. Not too overdone or over-processed, like Samsung cameras used to be, and just a bigger phone overall, actually kind of makes it a bigger handle to take a photo or video with so who knows, I might even help with stabilization, so the photos and 4k videos you get Out of this phone without even any editing or touch-ups, which you can do in a raw mode, continue to be really impressive. Now, a big part of what's made the note series, especially from the beginning, when it first came out, a very popular phone with power users like me, is not only the fact that it was always like a really big phone, but it just always had like all Of the latest, all the best features that Samsung's had to offer it's packed to the gills with features it's got. The S Pen, Stylus, it's got multitasking with multiple apps available at the same time, is basically doing everything it can to take advantage of the high-end hardware that you get so this phone is full of the best that Samsung makes and to be fair. Samsung has done a really good job of keeping a lot of the great features in the phone without making a software feel like overwhelming. There used to be just stuff everywhere, but it's pretty tame. Now it's actually a little bit more organized, so things are a little bit easier to find. This is a search function in the settings app so yeah. A lot of neat features are tucked in there and they're, not all screaming your face. They'Re just kind of waiting around the corner, so one of the newest flashiest ones is the iris scanner. It'S a new method for unlocking your phone that takes advantage of the new sensor in the top of the phone, along with an infrared light blaster that you can actually see in action when it's scanning and all it wants you to do is basically hold the phone Up to your face for a second while it reads your eyes to identify you and then logs you in it kind of seems like straight out of the future when it actually works. Well, as far as I know, it can't be fooled with photos of you or other people's eyes. I didn't think it's quite as secure as other security methods, but despite me wearing contacts which it says can impede it, it works really well. In fact, it actually seemed to learn my eyes over time, so, a week after setting this up, iris scanning was really fast. I still prefer a fingerprint reader, though, of course there are other things like the S. Pen features that evolved from year to year. With a note, I may not use this thing much, but when I do it's kind of nice, so the plan itself is now much more sensitive to different levels of pressure. The tip is smaller, so it feels like writing with an actual pen instead of like a marker, and it's now designed so you definitely can't stick it in backwards and break it. Oh yeah, and it's still clicky in case you're, wondering my favorite new S. Pen feature is the ability to screen capture instantly and then convert it into a jiff that you can share super useful and actually really fun. Plus you still have all the capture and drawing tools from before, so even with all these added features overall performance. On the note, 7 is pretty much always on point, as you would expect from high-end specs. Like this, I say pretty much, though, because every once in a while like I would wake it up and try to start using it, and it would just lag a lot for no reason for a couple seconds before it would snap out of it. I don't really know why it still does this like it's gotten a few software updates to possibly fix it, but it still does this sometimes, so I got to mention it, but anyway, when it's not doing that its handling everyday use like a beast, it's super smooth And snappy multiple apps open at the same time, swapping between them browsing a lot of gaming, a lot all that stuff, no problem. The one thing a lot of heavy use will hit, though, is definitely your battery life. This actually has a smaller battery than the galaxy s7 edge, even though it's a bigger phone, because it has that slot in the side for the stylus, so smaller battery and bigger screen on the front. So the battery life, on the note seven, is really just about average. It used to be that phone that everyone took to CES and everyone took two shows and long road trips, because it was that phone that had a massive battery and it was removable both of those things are no longer the case. I can definitely still get my three hours of screen on time with my heavy high brightness above average use, but I definitely have to charge it every night. I never really end a day with like 30 % left or anything, I'm pretty much, always looking for a charger by the end of the day. Anyway, there are a bunch of other little things that make the note 7 a great phone still for a power user. It has fast charging which i think is kind of underrated. The best fast charging phones are like life, savers to me it has wireless charging. Still. It has USB type-c, which I like, and a headphone jack of course, and there's expandable storage as well via microSD and the whole phone is also now water-resistant its ip67 certified. So this is the first year that the Galaxy Note gets this extra durability and that's really awesome to see. I feel like people, don't really appreciate how difficult it is to water seal a phone from the inside without affecting the outside, like we've seen water-resistant phones before that's, not new, but they all look like water-resistant phones, whether they have like a flap or something weird that Just doesn't look that good. This pretty much has the same exact design as you would expect. So that's a nice bonus. The only part that I would say actually does suffer from the waterproofing is the speaker. That'S speaker on the bottom: it's pretty weak and it's small and easy to block and it's not super loud. I mean pretty much all waterproof or water-resistant phones have some fault or difficulty with the speaker. That'S just a hard thing to do, but I think Samsung doesn't really have a big problem with this, because previous Samsung phones have had pretty lousy speakers anyway, so it gets moderately loud, but it's pretty tinny and distorted when it gets that loud so yeah. It'S that's. Probably the worst part of the phone right there. Now, of course, we got to address the elephant in the room. You'Ve probably been thinking about it. This whole review, and that would be explosions no matter how good a phone is if a hundred of them explode within a month of it being out, you yeah. No, that's that's pretty bad, you kind of messed out, so the note 7 has a bit of reputation. Now I get it, it's really easy to make jokes about how, but the the main. Officially, the main issue was with the battery overheating, while charging, especially in like hot environments like a car outside or while using third party chargers, while the batteries would actually swell up to the point where some of them would literally explode. So what Samsung did was offer a full voluntary recall which was kind of rocky. You probably know about the way carriers work in the United States, but they kind of did what they can. But now so, when they're selling note sevens, you know you have one of the batch that isn't at risk of exploding if it has a little green battery indicator on the front. That is one of the new batch. So if you're on, like a flight or something and the flight attendant says hey, is that a note? Seven, you got to power that down for the flight. At least you can point and be like hey. This is one of the new ones, so it actually won't explode. My never exploded, but that doesn't mean it would never have done anything weird. So I did return it. If you have an old one, you should to get a new one. I did and now we're all good, so assuming we're talking about the new note sevens the ones that are now being sold with the green battery indicator. This is the best phone that Samsung makes right now for sure I'll write alongside the galaxy s7 edge, which I think it can be a toss-up for which phone is better for certain people. This one is a little bit bigger has a little bit of a bigger display, but it's got it's just chock-full of features. It is stuffed to the gills and it is still a power users phone. It'S also pricey, but I would say it's also worth the price to have the best camera in any smartphone. The best display in any smartphone and one of the best experiences that Samsung has ever put together in the Android world overall, could recommend this phone again get the new one get the green battery and you're set either way. That'S been it. Thank you for watching this Galaxy. Note. 7 review hope you enjoyed.

yXYZQFTs8h0,Moto Z/Force Review!,10:46,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kip EHD here and the moto Z came out a few days ago. We had the Moto X before and I don't know what Moto Y is, but I think the gap is actually appropriate because Moto Z is a totally different phone than anything we've seen from Motorola or Lenovo in the past, and I like a lot of it. So here's what's up moto Z is a high-end flagship, speck, Android phone and it's actually two phones, there's the Moto Z and the Moto Z force. So moto Z is the thinner prettier version of the flagship. Five point: two millimeters thin 2600 milliamp hour battery gorilla glass on the front and the back and a 13 megapixel camera and Moto Z force is a slightly thicker version. So it's two millimeters thicker and it gets a shatterproof display, a 3,500 milliamp hour battery and a 21 megapixel camera. So right off the bat. The Moto Z force is a bit more expensive, but it's probably worth it. Unfortunately, these are also both exclusive to Verizon. Right now, the unlocked versions are coming later. I hate carrier, exclusives. I'Ve talked about that in the past. But what can you do? That'S just the way it is with these. So my favorite thing about this phone is actually the build quality, all metal and glass, no chassis flex or any creaking of any kind tight tolerances materially. This could be one of the best moto phones ever built and obviously they've built a lot of good phones and also do you think it looks pretty good in black and that's just my opinion, but obviously that's pretty subjective. But there's no arguing that this guy is well built and, as a result, it feels great to hold and carry it's really solid. There'S a microSD card slot up top for expandable storage, which is awesome and a single USB type-c port at the bottom, which is an interesting choice, but maybe a bit premature. I don't think this is a phone where you have to get rid of the headphone jack, but they did anyway using the phone I slowly got used to it, thanks to just attaching a USB C to headphone jack adapter to my headphones all the time it comes In the box - and I also use Bluetooth audio a bit more but yeah, of course, I still miss that headphone jack a lot. The buttons on the phone are clicky and everything, but they're a bit of a stretch with the volume buttons all the way at the top corner. I mean I have big hands so even for me, it's a stretch which means, if you have smaller hands. It'S probably a bit of a pain to reach them. The other side of the phone is blank, so they could have put the volume buttons over there on the left or put them below the power buttons. Like most other phones. But I'd say. Maybe the worst thing about this phone is that it's a pretty constant fingerprint magnet and it definitely doesn't look good with fingerprints. So if you hate them as much as I do, you can either grab a D brand skin for it, which leaves the pins at the bottom exposed and wipes out the fingerprints completely, which is great I'll link it below or you can grab a color swap piece From Motorola they're a little more expensive but they're weightier to put on and take off and I'll talk about them more in a second in this video. So aside from the frustrating buttons - and I guess maybe the lack of water resistance, moto Z is built great on the front - you have a fingerprint reader in this square that kind of doesn't match with the rest of the aesthetics on the front of the phone. But it's fast and it works well, so I'm not complaining that it's there and you can long press to read your finger and wake up and then, while it's on you can long press again to sleep, it's not actually a home button, no matter how many times You accidentally try and the screen we're looking at on the front is a 5.5 inch, quad HD AMOLED display again very good, really high pixel density. Obviously, and viewing angles are more than good enough. Pretty wide and colors stay accurate, it doesn't get quite as bright as Samsung's panels, but most don't it's not the easiest to see outdoors but other than that. The display on moto Z, looks pretty good and the software itself is Android 6.0 marshmallow right now with Moto's. Very light customizations on top, and a lot of this is at least familiar to what we've seen in other moto phones, even if the outside the package it comes in is way different. So you have, you know your screen off gestures, your chop-chop to turn the flashlight on and off, and the almost invaluable twisting twice to open the camera. For example, those things aren't going anywhere. You almost get used to them and miss them on other phones and then the inside the UI itself is still feeling a lot like stock Android. In the way it looks and feels which is great. I'M a fan of the clean look and I like what they did to use a lot of googles apps as their stock apps. This is something HTC did earlier, so even in the past there would be phones that would look and feel like kind of close to stock Android, but they use their own separate calculator and dialer and photos apps, and all these things that Google already makes so now With this phone you take a picture and you swipe over and you're in Google Photos right away. The one and only calculator app is the Google calculator, the one and only calendar app. Is the Google calendar now obviously not everyone's gon na notice or even care? But I think that's a really nice touch and it kind of gets nullified by the fact that it's a Verizon phone so now there's also a bunch of Verizon bloatware in there. But you know it's the thought that counts. So, aside from the Verizon bloatware, I'm a fan of the software experience, which means I'll, probably be really happy with the unlocked version later this year. I'M disappointed that Motorola isn't fully committing to the regular Google security updates like on time for Android, but I still think it'll get upgraded to new versions of Android faster than most phones and performances. You can probably already tell has been smooth with my time with this device, as you would expect, with a high-end device with top-notch specs animations are quick. Opening and closing, and switching between apps is quick. It'S snappy! I got pretty warm actually to the touch after using it for a while, or especially after a long session of either web browsing or gaming, not to the point of any performance issues, but still something to notice. Now the camera on the back of this phone is another weird point for the Moto Z. First of all, I can say that cameras and smartphones has never really been a strong point for Motorola. It'S just true. They'Ve never really had the top of the game. Smartphone cameras and sadly, that's still true with this camera. So here's the deal I did most of my testing with the Moto Z force so 21, a megapixel camera, F, 1.8 aperture optical image, stabilization, dual LED flash and for the most part the pictures looked pretty decent, especially in good lighting. It tends to overexpose a little bit which leads to more blow and highlights than lost shadows, but that's not a huge problem. There'S definitely a lot more noticeable processing, though first of all, you get a lot of sharpening going on and there's also plenty of noise reduction, and when you combine that you get some pretty soft or grainy night, shots depends on what you're taking a picture of which, In this kind of an area, the camera falls apart, pretty quick. It is not good at night or in low-light, but look that's not like it's not capable of taking great photos. Most high-end smartphone cam are capable of taking great photos, but when I say it's hit or miss that just means it's a little bit more miss than you would like it to be in your daily phone, but it can definitely hit if you get it in the Right conditions, also, if you're just selfies the front-facing camera, is pretty decent, it's a wide angle. It exposes well, and it has a front-facing LED flash, which you don't see every day. The actual camera bump on the back of this phone was pretty interesting, though, because with the thicker phone you would think they would get rid of the camera hump, but they didn't the thicker moto Z force has the exact same camera hump, and that's because it's probably The first phone to ever have a camera hump with a purpose. It has a function to it. It'S for keeping moto mods in place, so moto mods our Motorola's answer to the wave of modular smartphones we've seen in the past year, so those pins you saw at the bottom of the phone. That'S a combination of magnets and smart connectors that let the phone connect to a range of accessories like the color swap back. I told you about earlier and wrapping around the camera bump helps it hold in place super well now I don't even know if I'd call this stuff modular, because you're not really swapping anything or taking anything off the phone, but I'd more just call moto mods modification, Because it's easily the quickest and easiest way to just add functionality to a smart phone just by clicking it into place, you don't have to reboot the phone. You don't have to swap things in and out, there's no buttons, there's no clicking! There'S no rebooting! It'S just snap it into place in two seconds and it's secure and it fits and it works. So here are the mods we have now number one is the color swap backs? They just get rid of the camera bump and changes a color / material of the back of the phone, the battery backs. These are a little bit thicker and they snap on and they just immediately start charging the phone. The JBL speaker, which gets super loud way louder than the phone's single front facing speaker and also has a large battery extension and even a little kickstand and the projector, which has a built in battery for power and can project whatever is on your smart phone screen Onto a wall or any projectable surface, so motor mods are actually pretty awesome as they are now and we can cross our fingers for more to come since Motorola promises to try to make them work with future Motorola phones as well. Only problem is they're a little bit expensive and it's hard to buy into these with a promise of an ecosystem, especially your next phone might just come from Samsung or Apple or anyone else really. But I stand by that. This is the best execution of a smartphone mod that I have ever seen. Also, here's a million dollar idea, a moto mod with a high quality DAC and a headphone jack at the bottom and like a little battery in there. That would be awesome. You'Re welcome I'll. Take 10 % my favorite mod though besides probably the color swap one, is definitely the battery, because the battery life of the existing moto, Z and Z force is really super average. Obviously, the Moto Z has a 2600 milliamp hour battery. That can only take you so far with a big bright, quad HD display, I'm not surprised. I was only getting two and a half hours of screen on time and having to charge every single day. Didn'T shock me at all. Moto Z force has a thirty five hundred million power battery and again I'm getting like three hours and change of screen on time, which for me, is still charging every night when I'm using the phone with match brightness all day. But it's definitely like the battery mod is the easiest way to just click it on it's better than a battery case, because you don't have to like attach it around the phone when you attach it to the phone, it starts charging immediately. That'S pretty awesome! So, at the end of the day, moto Z is a great idea with great execution, but it's just not a complete package like especially if you're looking for a phone with a great battery life or a great camera thing. You'Re not gon na find it here, and you probably won't buy this phone for that, but a lot of what they tried is awesome, I'm glad they did it. Thank you, Lenovo / moto, for trying this and making moto mods work so well, and I do hope it works really well, and I do hope there are more third-party moto mods from other companies that just want to get in on this on the ground floor, because Generation one it's pretty damn good, so that's been it! Thank you for watching I'll talk to you guys, the next one peace """
ycIpOZY03OM,OnePlus 3 Review!,11:42,"Hey what is up guys MP PhD here - and this is the third phone from oneplus. It'S the one plus three, it's a new phone from a not so new anymore company, so oneplus has made their name from their previous two phones, the oneplus one and the oneplus. Two and both were really well known for their impressive specs for a low price, big specs, small price, that's what oneplus does best and they are absolutely back at it again with this one plus three, so just to get them out the way this one plus three Is rocking a Snapdragon 820 chip, the audrina 530 GPU 64 gigs of non-expandable flash storage and six gigs of ram six gigabytes of ram? Obviously they're flexing a little bit here, but we'll get to that in a bit. So I think the design is one of this phones best assets this year. It'S pretty clean all around it's a full unibody metal jacket, as you can see clean lines and subtle, curves to feel good in the hand and quality button placement, so they're all easily recognizable and easy to press, and it actually keeps that alert slider from last year. That I liked I still wish I could reverse the order of the alert slider and the settings to make going down the silent switch, but whatever it's still there, but overall yeah, it's a simple low-risk design. Oneplus didn't take any huge Gamble's with the outside of this phone because that's not really what they do. If you look at this phone, you don't really see anything design-wise that hasn't showed up in another smartphone before it, so they didn't like take away the headphone jack or anything they didn't go with dual cameras or detachable modules or magnets or pins. It'S really much closer to, I guess a traditional look. It even looks a little bit like the iPhone 6s on the bottom. You could say with some slightly different angles and some different looking chapters and ports I'd say the worst thing about this design is probably the camera bump on the back, which is definitely brand new, because I used to praise oneplus for filling out the smartphone body with Battery deer, every smartphone manufacturer, ever if you're, using a large camera module, which you probably are feel free to fill out the rest of the phone's body with battery like this, it will not make the phone too heavy or too thick, and everyone will appreciate the extra Battery thank you. Now I get the one plus three that is way thinner, has a camera bump and has a smaller battery anyway, up front on this phone is classic one plus here a 1080p display and your choice between capacitive buttons or on-screen buttons thanks oxygen OS. I happen to prefer the capacitive ones this time around and the display is again really good for a 1080p display. It'S not going to match the quad HD panels from Samsung and sharpness or brightness, but those are the best panels on the market and this little guy puts up a respectable fight. It'S a 5.5 inch OLED display with some really thin side, bezels less than a millimeter. On each side I like that - and it gets pretty bright, so it's viewable outdoors and of course, it's battery efficient. By definition now know the irony of launching a 1080p phone with the VR event did not go unnoticed, but oneplus actually just kind of says. Yet people don't really do the whole smartphone in headset thing very often so 1080p is just fine and I tend to agree with them on that. Plus these high-end chips inside are so used to powering these big quad HD panels that you pretty much eliminate any graphic slowdowns with the audrina 530 just pushing 1080p things are super smooth battery gets a nice benefit, and most people don't know the difference if they never Hold it up next to a galaxy s7, the display looks really good. The fingerprint reader is also much improved. It seems to be now to me the second-fastest fingerprint reader I've ever used in a smartphone right up next to touch ID on the new iPhones. I would really only sometimes have it forget my finger once in a while, but that was rare, so I loved being able to secure my phone really quickly but still unlock. My phone super fast fingerprint reader was a nice touch to see it improved and actually using this phone is the best part of it. In my opinion, again, it's not really that risky at all. It'S oxygen, OS 3.11 based on android marshmallow as you'd expect from oneplus, and it has that stock ish Nexus feel plus a bunch of extra usability features stuffed in there for a better experience. Nothing crazy, not a huge skin or a bunch of new icons or bloatware, or anything like that, but more like pure Android, plus a bunch of neat customization features that are awesome if you want to use them, but they stay out of the way. If you don't, you can definitely tell oxygen. Os has gotten a lot of fine-tuning and polish since the last version, especially on the oneplus 2. So that's nice to see - and I usually go straight for the Google launcher on most new smartphones, but I like that home screen customization here is now super easy. So, with a long press you can now mess around with what type of Google search bar you have home screen, grid, size, etc, and even the Shelf is back and a bit better than before. I still don't use it much to the left of all your home screens, but now you can add, memos or pin frequent contacts reminders stuff like that it holds an auto refresh in weather widget now, which is cool. I still think Google now cards are way more useful, though I kind of just wonder if they could have built in a page like that, but I guess I'll have to settle with a widget or eventually using the Google launcher anyway, but either way as you would Probably expect, with these top notch, specs a 1080p display and near stock Android and fast flash storage, and it just absurd 6 gigabytes of RAM. This very well may be the smoothest quickest, Android handset. I'Ve ever used alongside Nexus 6p right now, I'm just hoping it lasts. So some phones start off smooth, but then they find a way to stutter and chop even with high-end specs, because of their software, their bloat I'll be using this phone for a couple of weeks now and it's held up just fine, I don't think I ever got Over 4 gigabytes of active RAM usage during my regular use, even with a game in the background - and I don't know if a preload times even matter after a certain point, because the ones that were cleared from Ram opened up fast again anyway, battery life. Through all this was also pretty good, although I think I kind of expected a little better. It was inconsistent at first, but then it leveled out. I would give it a B B sort of good rating with a 3000 milliamp hour battery and a 1080p display. So I was consistently getting near 4 hours of screen on time. With my usage, I got ta wonder, though, what they could have done if they didn't make the phone so thin. I mean 7.3 millimeters in a Full Metal Jacket, it's sexy and everything, but I got to wonder how it would have lasted if they follow their own example from last year and made it a little thicker with like a 3600 milliamp hour battery or something but oh Well now, one of the headlining features of this phone is actually they're fast charging, which they call charging. You actually get a four amp charger in the box, which sounds crazy, because most smartphones are one or two amp chargers and it charged so fast. It actually changed. My charging habits this phone and the galaxy s7 are actually the only phones I stopped charging overnight and just started topping them off whenever they were low like in the morning, when I wake up, I mean you can still charge every night if you want to, but When you plug in and get 60 % charge in half an hour, it kind of stopped needing to so charging is apparently much more efficient with temperature regulation, which is why the brick is a little bigger, but it'll keep pumping the current even when the phone is On and the screen is on and when you're using it, where that's, where most other phones will slow down their quick charge, there is no wireless charging, since it's the metal back, but I'm happy with the convenience of fast charging. This guy, just like I, am with the galaxy s7, the camera on the oneplus 3. Has you guessed it? No big gambles, but just a solid bunch of choices that put it together. It'S a 16 megapixel Sony sensor, F, 2.0 aperture has optical image, stabilization and phase detection autofocus for the quickness. The camera app itself is decently fast, both to open up and take a picture. So that's good and by default, auto HDR is enabled, so it doesn't take that much extra time to actually take and process that shot. So that's nice focus is nice and quick, but of course you can turn off HDR to speed it up a little more. If you know you're not going to need that, but the photos it takes are, I would say, fairly well balanced, they're, sort of tiptoeing a line between being vibrant, but not too oversaturated and I'd, say crisp without being super over sharpened. Again, you can tell there's definitely sharpening, but it's not too crazy exposure. I'D say it likes to overexpose just a little bit like a lot of other smartphone cameras, but that's fine, because dynamic range is actually really good, and this is all really nice to see from a smartphone that costs way less than the top dogs. Usually, you see the camera quality dropping off as one of the big sacrifices in smartphones that drop the price a lot. This is one of the areas where the oneplus 3 held up. That really makes it worth a while. This is awesome. I think the mark of a good camera is one that lets you just snap, a picture and then put it away and forget about it and it's an amazing picture and actually kind of happened to me. So I was up on campus in a sort of a low-light scenario. I was going to go meet and people who play frolf - and I just looked around - and I said hey this - this is like a nice low-light camera test sort of environment. So I took a disc out snap, the photo of it and then put it away and then we went and played frolf. Of course, I come back to my computer a couple hours later and it's uploaded to Google photos and I take a look at it and I realize, like that's, that's nice, like that's a really good low-light photo. This is the first shot I took and I didn't even think about taking another one. I just open the app snapped it put it away and went on with the day and it looks pretty clean, so performed pretty admirably in low-light in Auto. Obviously, moving objects are still going to be a blur, but the camera also has full manual mode. If you want to get fancy with it, it has that and the raw photos and to top it off 4k video with stabilization. So it's a complete smartphone camera package and that actually kind of summarizes the oneplus three. You know it's, despite being so simple, really is still the complete package. It doesn't have any huge, big gimmicks or risks that may or may not be worth the money like trying to be modular or something like that, but it also isn't like having any glaring emissions or missing sensors or missing NFC, like maybe it did last year. You can even say it's boring, but you know there's a couple. First party oneplus material cases, so you can check those out if you want the sandstone back, of course, or there's deep brand skins. If you want even more looks this, for example, is the concrete look. You could say it's groundbreaking I'll link them below, but it comes down to this. My 5 pillars for a great smartphone are still great performance, display battery life camera and build quality, and it pretty much nails all those again. I said before smartphones in the last couple years are getting so good that we tend to measure them by what's wrong with them, instead of what's right about them, and this applies again we're at the worst thing about the 1 3. Is that it's so damn clean? It'S just almost boring almost unexcited when you see other smartphones actually trying to be you know, modular or having these removable parts or magnets and pins or showing up with these fancy dual camera systems or trying to be shatterproof. All those things are cool, but oneplus isn't trying to do any of that they're just showing up crushing the spec game and selling it for less than the phone you were thinking about buying I mean six eggs a ram. I think you want that. So that's the story for this phone. It'S a pretty clean experience. I'D say it's a green light to buy if you're coming from a previous like one or two year, old stock, Android phone like a nexus 5x or a oneplus one or a Nexus 5. This is an awesome upgrade and even just compared to other things in the price range. The experience is top-notch so uh, that's pretty much it thanks for watching this video review. Hope you enjoyed it I'll talk to you guys, the next one thanks """
9kiECQodMqE,HTC 10 Review!,7:00,"Hey what is up guys on to Bhd here and better late than never HTC? Ten final verdict as a smartphone. This is a really really good phone, so you probably already knew that, but after using this phone for the past couple weeks, I kind of realized it surprised me how underrated it is. It'S just really good at a lot of things and I think most anyone would agree it's the complete package, so it pretty much nails everything you look for in a flagship smartphone, so the build it nails that this phone is all metal all the way around. So anytime you're holding it you're touching metal, which is awesome and the sides are also pretty flat, which is important. So, even though it's kind of a chunky phone it's easy to hold and then for looks it has this big chamfer all the way around the edges of the rounded back and that really characterizes this device. So there's plenty of other metal devices, but the chamfer color. It sort of changes as it catches the light from different angles. So it's really nice. It'S like classic. Htc, hey! You know what the most underrated piece of hardware that actually really makes a smart phone is good buttons seriously and HTC. Ten has great buttons, a textured clicky power button and a separate, very tactile, clicky volume rocker, so a good grade for both of those. The only knock I have on the build is that it's not ip68 water-resistant, but it is still IP 53 technically, so it can handle a misting just fine. Now the display it also pretty much nails that so you're working with a 5.2 inch quad HD super LCD display. It looks good as you'd expect pretty vibrant and color accurate, not the brightest thing in the world, but you know just barely visible in outdoor sunlight and it looks great and sharp everywhere else. The speaker's this was an interesting point compared to previous HTC phones, because those were legendary for boomsound front-facing speakers. Here on the HTC 10, we have two speakers, one larger driver on the bottom for low and mid frequencies and then another one up in the earpiece at the top and the cutout for high frequencies, and they work together, sort of like a woofer and tweeter pair. At it sounds pretty good, it's definitely way better than the worst speakers out there, so that's good, but it's still no front-facing stereo pair, which is what I got used to from HTC in the past, even other devices. Now, like my Nexus 6p now. Obviously, this isn't a big deal to some people. Plenty of people will use headphones anyway, which are great with this phone. But it's something to note. This is a pretty middle-of-the-road speaker setup, the specs yeah. Of course, it nailed those Snapdragon 820 chip, Adreno 550 GPU, 4 gigabytes of RAM and as a bonus, expandable storage. So there's a SIM card tray on one side and the other side, a micro SD card slot for those that cherish that kind of glad these made it come back in 2016 and in the performance Department. This phone has stayed fast. I kind of mentioned in the first impressions video that it felt quick. Obviously that's right out the box, but responsiveness is on point, and this is something HTC worked on a lot with their new software and I've had no slowdowns with day-to-day use with this guy. So opening and closing apps is quick. Multitasking is quick and a lot of the normal in-between stuff feels so quick and snappy, because the animations are shortened a lot. In fact, just the software in general on this phone since 8:00 is now one of my favorite skins. I'Ve seen on Android to date in a long time, it's pretty close to stock Android in look and feel - and I like that, not just because it's stock ish, but because it's good and just that one extra level of customization beyond a signage and mod rom or Something so you have HTC's themes, store and a couple extra features here and there and hardware optimizations, but still a mostly stock, feel. So I dig it removing duplicate apps, to clean the app drawer and make things less confusing was a good move and not overloading the phone with a whole bunch of weird features and gestures and stuff was also a good move. Keep saying simple top all that off with a 3000 milliamp hour battery and you're, looking at pretty consistently smooth performance that actually lasts a whole day, I'm a lot happier with again the battery life of flagship phones this year to this HTC ten is getting me. My four and a half hours of screen on time and has great standby, so pretty much matches the galaxy s7 if a little bit short and I almost never use any of the power saving features. So I'm happy about that. One place that I'd say that this phone is kind of lacking. Is the camera I'm not recommending this phone to anyone for the camera. So if you're a person who takes a lot of photos or a lot of videos and is really into the camera, this isn't your number-one choice. It'S probably top ten, but it's not the best. So, if that's what you're looking for then this is not your phone. Htc 10 is rocking a 12 megapixel camera with an F 1.8 aperture optical image. Stabilization LED flash and laser autofocus all good specs on paper image, quality wise, it's just above average, so you can see from the shots I've taken. You can definitely get really good photos and 4k videos out of this phone. No question, especially in good light, so color accuracy is solid, nothing's too, over sharpened or oversaturated, which is cool and then with the F 1.8 aperture. You can also get that nice, shallow depth of field and blurred background if you want and then that also helps, of course, a lot combining with OIS to do a little bit better than average in low-light uh. It still breaks down, but you know you get the idea. I think it tends to err. Err on the side of overexposure definitely has a bit more blown out highlights than crushed shadows usually, but since it's doing auto HDR so quickly, dynamic range is also pretty good. I put it in the top few cameras on smartphones for sure, but again the galaxy s7 s and iPhones of the world are going to take better photos for sure overall, if CC, 10 gets a lot of the little things right stuff. Like the expandable storage, like I mentioned, it's a nice bonus for people who take a lot of videos and photos or have a lot of music. The fingerprint sensor is also a nice touch. It'S pretty quick, not the quickest, it's behind touch ID and I'd, say Samsung and Huawei, but top five for sure and things like the super high quality DAC. This smartphone will actually drive your higher powered headphones and those who pay attention will notice the great audio from the headphone jack of this guy there's also airplay support right out the box on HTC 10. That'S a first Ranny Android phone, so it has a lot going for it. So, at the end of the day like we said this, HTC 10 is a really good phone. It'S not perfect by any means, definitely still has its quirks. What you might consider flaws, but it checks pretty much all the boxes and it does most of what you would expect out of a flagship smartphone, so the beauty, the power and the nice clean OS. I think it'll be even more interesting later this year. Now that works to see at least the rumors point to an HTC made Nexus phone coming out later this year, and then that should take a lot of the design keys from this phone, but we'll reserve judgment until we see that. That'S basically it for this review. Thanks for watching I'll talk to you guys, the next one bass """
Tx_lyy4-SeY,iPhone SE Review!,4:59,"Huh look familiar: this is the newest iPhone. This is the iPhone se. It looks familiar because it's the iPhone 5s body with all the same features from the iPhone 6s. So it's this four year old flagship on the outside and an eight month old flagship on the inside and with this phone Apple, is basically answering the call for a small flagship smartphone. All the high-end phones. These days are big phones. Do a lot screens got bigger and I see in the comments all the time like people talking about it on Twitter, what's the best small smartphone you can get that doesn't make any compromises will be cool to see more of those well, this phone is definitely small. So it looks like it's kind of trying to fill those shoes so yeah. It really is the iPhone 5 and 5s body and all its rectangular chamfered glory. The 5s was my first iPhone ever so I kind of liked this squarish design. It'S definitely easier to hold with those flat sides, then the round iPhones we have now. I still would have liked to have seen a new design, though for a brand new compact phone in 2016 instead of a recycled one, but this is what we got. So the only way you could tell you have an iPhone se and not an iPhone 5 is the rose gold color or that little SE badge on the back, which apparently stands for special edition. That'S it! Otherwise, it looks exactly the same unless you add any skin or case to it, of course, I'll link this one below, but when I first got the se out the box, I've been using. You know big phones for the past few years, so seeing a tiny phone that just gets swallowed up in my hands was like nope no way no way. I could use this phone every day and do all the same stuff that I'm used to doing on a bigger screen, but it actually turned out to be not that bad. Thanks to the high-end specs, and now I feel like I want to see more high-end, smaller Android phones, too. First of all, a smaller phone makes it easier, especially for people with small hands, to reach all four corners of the display and that's important to be able to do that without adjusting your grip, it's comfortable, so it's great for all those top left corner buttons in Ios and then the smaller phone is just generally easier to handle it's less phone in the pocket, less in the hand when you're on a call, it's also a little bit lighter. I mean I just kind of started getting used to it like I got you two bigger phones, but there are definitely downsides, though the display is the biggest one or I guess the smallest one. This is still the four inch Retina display from the iPhone 5. So 11, 36 by 640 and when your sub 720p, you can never quite match the viewing experience or the gaming experience or anything of a phone with a big display and front-facing speakers. No matter how good the performance is. But I'm happy to report that performance is not a problem at all. The iPhone se, like I mentioned, has most of the same features from the newest iPhone so including the specs. So you get an A 9 ship and 2 gigabytes of RAM for a low res display. So basically performance is a breeze here. Everything is smooth. Multitasking is great, that's what you would expect and the camera upgrade is also from the iPhone 6s. So a new 12 megapixel sensor and a slightly smaller aperture has this taking very similar photos and 4k videos to the iPhone 6s. Now there's no optical image stabilization, but everything else is on point. The autofocus is super quick, there's, a quick shutter that you used to from other iPhones I'll go right ahead and say this is the best camera in a small smartphone. So that's got that going for it and the front-facing camera unfortunately didn't get the same, upgrade treatments. So you're getting a pretty weak 1.2 megapixel shooter. Here it's not awful, but sorry selfie people and there's other little things that just set it back a little bit like it has touch ID, but it's the older first gen touch ID. So it feels just a little bit slower and there's no forced touch pressure, sensitivity again from the newer iPhones, so no force touching shortcuts and stuff like live photos uses a long press instead. Now, I think again, if Apple had designed a new small iPhone for 2016 they'd have both of those things. They'D have the new touch ID and force touch, but again, since they recycle the old body, there's not quite enough room for that and there you have it. It'S pretty much everything you need to know about using an iPhone se. The one thing that surprised me actually was battery life. It is a small phone and it has have a small 1642 milliamp hour battery, but the life is actually very good and I guess I'd attribute that to the a9 chip. Everything else fell right in line where I expect it. It'S just a really freaking small phone. So for 400 bucks should you buy it uh, it's not for everyone, that's for sure, plus you're, only getting 16 gigabytes at that price and I'd pretty much, never tell anyone to buy a 16 gig phone so for 500 or 600 bucks you'd have to really want A small phone after using it for a while, especially for reach ability, I kind of get the desire for smaller phones, not saying I could personally do it forever. She'S not my thing, but I get it thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys, the next one peace """
ZvPxjhTOEgM,Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Review!,6:10,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm QB HP here, and this is the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge and by popular demand. This is a quick video about just all the differences between the galaxy s7 edge and galaxy s7 and maybe which one you would want to pick if you're torn. So this video can be pretty short because Samsung simplified their lineup a lot from last year, where they had a galaxy s6 galaxy s6 active galaxy, s6 edge and galaxy s6 edge this year. We just get two phones, galaxy s7 and galaxy s7 edge. That'S it! So. First off there are different sizes. Yes, the galaxy s7 is a sort of a mid to large size phone with a 5.1 inch display, but the s7 edge is firmly in big phone territory at 5.5 inches and then everything else about the displays on paper is the same. So they're, both these bright quality, quad HD Super AMOLED displays and then, of course, the larger display has a slightly lower pixel density number. But you won't notice they're, both ridiculous and the s7 edge is rocking that curved glass on both sides which earn it its name. The glass just kind of overflows over both edges now something barely talked about. Besides the different screen sizes is some other dimensions. The galaxy s7 edge is 0.2 millimeters, thinner and 5 grams, heavier than the regular galaxy, s7, now being heavier makes sense. Since it's a bigger phone, but the bigger problem of the old s6 edge was the sides being hard to hold, since it felt kind of like a blade in the hand. But Samsung did some work with new shaping on the back and side metal rails. Here of the phone are different this year and it's not as hard to pick up or literally a pain to hold, even when the edge is so thin. So the shape of the edge is still very much different from the regular s7. But it's less dramatic, while still being easily one of the prettiest phones out there hands down now. One of the other Hardware things is the larger galaxy. S7 edge also has a pretty significantly larger battery now, since it also has a bigger screen. The translation to battery life is a little less significant, but I actually do see a bit of a difference. I'D say maybe 10 to 15 percent longer battery life in the s7 edge thanks to the bigger battery, and that right. There is enough of a reason for me to really like having the extra space inside and then. Lastly, of course, with the curves on either edge of the display Samsung built in some software into the s7 edge to take advantage of it and a software is better than last year, but could still be better here's. Why? So? It still has this tab to swipe out from the side to get to some shortcuts, and then you can keep swiping, of course, to move between different pages of different styles of shortcuts. So, first of all, you can choose where exactly this tab is on your screen. Just kind of lives there you can put it top right top lower right top left. If your lefty bottom-left, wherever you hold your hand, it's supposed to be easily accessible with your thumb and you can have it be smaller, bigger, more or less transparent, even invisible whatever, and then you can choose which edge panel shows up when you swipe. So if you don't want the contact shortcut to show up, you can just turn that off or you can add stuff like a sports scores, spoiler tab. Then there are a couple more things that aren't you know on by default, like weather and a compass they're all disabled, but then there's a little mini store, a Samsung mini store just for buying and downloading more of these tabs there's only about like another dozen, but Hey, if you find something you like you can buy it so apps edge is cool right. It'S just a couple shortcuts to your favorite apps from wherever you are. If you get into a certain app a lot, then you can always have it at your fingertips from just a thumb swipe in used to need a third-party app to do that. Now, it's built into the software. The next one over is called task edge. Where you can add shortcuts to different actions within apps, so like switching opening, just the front-facing camera or starting a stopwatch inside the clock, app stuff like that now fun fact, years ago way before this phone came out, I used to do exactly this. On my galaxy s3, with an app called swipe pad, swipe pad still exists today and still does all of this as good as the edge display feature here, if not better, because samsung's version here it only features a couple first party, apps 9 to be exact, and Some of them - I don't even use, so I would love to be able to add third-party apps, like opening up a new tweet function in my Twitter app or a shortcut to open up the camera inside the Instagram, app or just little stuff like that. But I can't do any of that. None of them are supported. There is so much that can make this tasks edge. Section like my favorite Android skin feature ever, but I just don't think they even plan on adding support for third-party apps. So for now it's just a couple of things that you may or may not even use anyway past that you have people edge for your contacts, and you know the layout, you sports thing, this favorite, NBA or NFL, or hockey or baseball or whatever sports teams. You watch and I throw any calendar in there to for myself, but that's pretty much it you can swipe between these tabs from wherever you are on the phone and they're quick and handy access, and that's about it for the galaxy s7 edge a bit of software. A little bit of Kirby glass that make this phone different from the regular s7, which has its own entire review. Of course, everything else is the same from the camera to the speakers, to the buttons to the internal specs, both flagships in their own right. So, at the end of the day, the answer to a question, a lot of you guys were asking is which one I prefer between the edge and the regular s7, and I definitely prefer the edge for the two reasons. One I have bigger hands. I usually use bigger phones and two I'm a bit more of a power user, and the larger battery is definitely a big help here. I would almost never recommend actually the regular s7 over the edge unless you really don't like the edge features or we have particularly small hands, but even then the regular s7 is not the smallest phone in the world anyway. So yeah, I tend to recommend the galaxy s7 edge a lot more than I recommend the s7. That being said, thanks for watching this quick video, let me know what you guys think, which one you guys like more in the comments section below that like button and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace """
1sgeM6DsV40,Samsung Galaxy S7 Review!,9:10,"Hey what is up guys MP PhD here - and this is a full view of the Samsung Galaxy s7. So this is a phone that's similar in a lot of ways to its predecessor, the one that came before it, which would be the galaxy s6. So the easiest way to talk about this phone and to completely understand it, is to look at all the differences between it and the one that came before it. So this is everything you need to know. That'S new and different about the galaxy s7. So, first of all, the body is slightly different. It'S slightly upgraded and most people hear that to mean it got thinner, but this phone is actually slightly thicker and I'm calling that the upgrade, because it's allowing one a much smaller camera bump on the back and to a much smaller home button, / the fingerprint reader Bump on the front actually had a lot less accidental home button presses with this phone. So that's nice and the phone is still pretty thin, but the extra space inside is packing a much larger 3000 milliamp hour battery. So that's pretty important and then they focused on the shape and the hand a little bit more. So the edges are left sharp. The phone is easier to pick up and hold, and the back glass is more rounded on the sides, like the galaxy note, 5 and then the rest is all the same premium materials from last year, so Gorilla, Glass, 4 on the front and back and then metal Rails on the sides and really nice buttons - I don't think Samsung gets enough credit for how nice the buttons are. They pretty much have the power button and volume buttons on point. So, overall, you get the idea that the build is slightly improved but still very familiar. In fact, this is definitely still the slipperiest phone I've ever held or used alongside the note 5 like this has slipped out of my pocket, while sitting in a car multiple times. Oh yeah, overall, the shape and build of this phone is definitely one of those incremental improvements from last year. Ok, the next difference is IP 68. This phone is now totally dust, sealed and water-resistant, so you can use it in the rain or near a pool or at a beach or get splashed or whatever it's fine, and it does it all internally. So there's no like weird flaps or anything over the USB ports or the headphone jack. I love that the design stays the hit as it gets waterproofed here. The one downside is definitely the speakers. The speakers suffer massively here pretty sure the galaxy s7 just got the biggest downgrade of any speakers on a smartphone they're now way tenure and distorted sounding, and he can blame that fully on the waterproofing. So the galaxy s7 also got the micro SD card slot back. I did not expect that to actually happen. I threw that out there in an older like predictions video as a sort of a oddball feature that might happen, but you do actually have it now. You do have expandable storage in the galaxy s7 and of course you can't have a new flagship phone without all your new flagship specs, and you get all of that here. So in the US. That'S the Snapdragon 820 chip, Adreno, 430 and 4 gigabytes of ram and performance is definitely up to snuff to match. This is a really quick and snappy phone again like the galaxy s6 was and we're getting much improved Ram management as well. That'S big here, I'm glad to see this phone handle multitasking that much better than its predecessor, which kind of occasionally had issues holding apps and RAM with metal and glass. It still does get a bit warm even with the new internal cooling, but nothing too severe. Just a little warm to the touch when you're gaming for a while or doing some heavy browsing, but just with everyday use. It'S fine wireless charging heats up a bit, but I'll talk about that later so yeah. This phone is fast again, that's one of its biggest strengths and definitely one of the biggest reasons to get it so, the last but not least, actually the biggest difference with the new s7 is the new camera, this new 12 megapixel camera. This is my favorite camera on any smartphone right now and that's putting it on top of a very good heap of other smartphone cameras out there, and I got to say there is no shooter. That consistently makes me feel as confident as a photo and video taker. As the galaxy s7 and that's what really makes a good photo experience for me, so the camera app opens with that double top of the home button, really quick from anywhere again super fast and it's immediately ready for a shot. There'S no shutter lag or anything. It'S very quick to just grab a photo and a lot of people. Look at the new 12 megapixel photo number and think: oh, wait! That'S less! Megapixels than last year. It'S not a big deal. 12 megapixels is still plenty, and these pixels are now larger, which, along with the optical image stabilization and the huge F 1.7 aperture, should help a lot with low-light. Should the photo quality in auto mode is again very typical, Samsung, so very bright, punchy, colors lots of saturation and contrast and sharpening they've been doing this forever. So I get it one thing: that's more notable! Is that F 1.7 aperture, it's so easy to blow backgrounds! Out-Of-Focus, even in broad daylight, with normal subjects, if you get close enough to the subject, you can get that blurry background, which is pretty crazy and the new dual pixel autofocus handles the shallow depth of field really well pretty much, always nails it so photos pretty. Much. Always looks solid, coming off this phone I'd say the biggest weakness is it tends to overexpose a bit in daylight conditions. There are definitely more blown highlights than crushed shadows, although throughout the pictures I've taken, it's actually not the best in low-light. Here'S an example of the exact same picture I took on the galaxy s7 versus my Nexus. 6P now Nexus is haven't even always had the best image processing, but it clearly beats the s7 here. So I would have liked to have seen - I guess, less grain from the s7 camera and low-light and a little bit more control exposure during the day. Here'S the thing, though, that autofocus is the best part of this new camera and it's crazy fast, also in video mode. It'S just as fast making this pretty much the ideal for high quality video. If you want to shoot 4k video in the easiest possible way and guarantee usable footage, this phone is the one to have over all the fast autofocus, combined with the fast aperture and the fast camera app make this the fastest smartphone camera alongside the iPhone. And it's a pleasure to use for that reason: oh and that front-facing camera is not bad, also, five megapixels and also an F 1.7 aperture and an even wider angle than the back camera. It'S not quite as sharpened or oversaturated, but it takes a pretty good selfie. If you're into that, so there you have it a couple of incremental but important changes that make the galaxy s7 a different beast. Plus, I guess all the things about the galaxy s6 that were already pretty great the best display in any smartphone the 5.1 inch quad HD Super AMOLED that gets super bright, the premium materials, the fast home button fingerprint reader - that's, I think, second, only to touch ID And some quick charging and wireless charging of a new larger battery and the actual life for me with a larger battery was really impressive too. I would give myself like a B or a minus four as far as how long this lasts during the day, pretty much. Never had to charge it before the end of the day and I was getting somewhere between five to five and a half hours of screen on time, typically, which is a big improvement over the notably bad battery life of the galaxy s6. So something I was really excited to see and you also still have fast-charging. You still have wireless charging. You still have fast wireless charging. It does get a little bit warm to the touch when your wireless charging, but other than that pretty much. No complaints about the new battery now it's definitely not perfect, it still has its flaws. I made an entire video about that and if you want to watch that it'll be linked in this corner or below that like button and it's missing a couple things, you know it doesn't have an IR blaster. Some people were confused about the dropping of that. It'S also like I mentioned the slipperiest phone ever and definitely looks and feels better with a case or even better a nice skin on it, plus you kind of hide the fingerprints and make it easier to hold I'll link the D brand skin below. I think that mat looks clean and it's definitely still not everyone's favorite software, so this Samsung scan on top of Android. Obviously, since it's Android, you can still go to town with the skins and custom launchers and really make it your own. But someone like me will do that within minutes of setting it up someone who's not really into it, might take a while and might not like it out the box. But overall I really like this phone. Some of the little stuff that used to be third-party apps Samsung is picking up on it and building it into their own software. So stuff, like the always-on display, is a nice touch. So, for example, since it's always an AMOLED display, you can choose to always have a clock calendar or still image when the phone is sleeping and it avoids burnin by moving around the display. Periodically doesn't burn too much battery. I think it's cool. If you use a calendar a lot, it would be cool to have that always on. I'M not sure why you want a still image, but hey there's always that option but yeah it's taken a lot of stuff like this and adding it into their own software. So if you don't find it on day, one then you'll probably find it a little while down the road after using this phone for a while, but at the end of the day the big question is: is this galaxy s7 worth the upgrade over whatever phone? You have now, if you have something like a galaxy s6 or even a high-end phone from last year, it might not be worth all the changes. The couple of things you do get if you're really really into video. This is the best video camera on a smartphone. Now and if you're really into having a better battery life, this is definitely a better battery life than the galaxy s6. But if you're gon na upgrade, if you have to and you're not really sure, I would at least opt for the galaxy s7 edge, which is a little bit bigger. But you also get those edge features and you get an even larger battery for even better battery life overall, a pretty well-rounded experience, nope that was totally intended. So that's been it thanks for watching this review. Video hopefully enjoyed it, feel free to give it a thumbs up. If you do and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace """
O6aSIa1sk6g,Nextbit Robin Review: Unlimited Storage?,5:37,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here - and this is the next fit Robin, and it's supposed to be the smartphone that never runs out of storage, at least that's what they claimed so as a new $ 400 smartphone. This thing is actually really interesting. Anytime. You get an entire phone made by a brand new company, there's some decisions that have to be made to put it on the map and the Robin is no exception so next fit Robin. Is this very squared off rectangular phone with tight corners? It kind of looks a little uncomfortable at first, but it has this sort of soft touch finish and it actually feels really good in the hand it has a decent balance of weight. It'S got well fitted parts and it's durable enough that it feels like you could hurt someone with this thing. So it's well-built. It feels good. You'Ve got your power button on the right hand, side, which is also a fingerprint reader and your tiny volume buttons on the left hand side. I think these might be the worst part of the build. The buttons are small with very little travel and then the power button on the right it doesn't protrude at all, so it can be kind of hard to tell which side is up without looking. The fingerprint reader is actually really good, though the speed and accuracy are on point and pro tip with the side placement like this, I actually kind of like it. You can have two fingers registered your left index finger and your right thumb for the way you grip. The phone anyway USB type-c at the bottom left corner with a quick charging light and on the front dual stereo front-facing speakers. I love this they're loud and clear, so that's awesome for gaming, listening to music and watching videos etc. The great choice there now from here. You can pick it up and use it kind of just like a normal four hundred hour, Android smartphone, it's running the latest version of Android 6.0 and it's a custom next bit skin which we'll get to in a second. But a lot of the elements still feel pretty stock. So like the notifications, the lockscreen, the quick settings, etc, the specs are pretty good too Snapdragon, 808, 3 gigabytes of RAM and a 2680 milliamp hour battery I'd, say the performance to the specs were up to par. Pretty smooth throughout which is an occasional force, close or a weird storage problem, but the battery life was a little worse. I was getting like three and a half hours of screen on time, which is less than I expected out of a 5.2 inch 1080p display the 13 megapixel camera on the back was decent kind of reminded me of the BlackBerry, Prive camera, actually so colors out of It were fine and detail was fine, but dynamic range was a little weak. So a lot of stuff got overexposed but overall solid for the budget, just a little slow to actually take the photos in a custom next fit camera app. As you can see, that shutter lag is real, but so how is this the phone that doesn't run out of storage? Well, all the magic is buried here in the next bit skin. So every next bit Robin comes with 32 gigs of on-board storage, but then also a hundred gigs of free cloud storage. Now right off the bat. That'S not unlimited, but whatever that's a lot more than 32 gigs and then the Robin is supposed to be smart enough and it is to offload the oldest and least frequently used stuff from the internal storage straight to the cloud when it hasn't been accessed in a While so, when you start to fill the 32 gigabytes old, apps and old photos that haven't been opened in a while, we'll move to the cloud and make room for more and the idea is for that to happen seamlessly almost without you ever having a notice. Now this is the next bit launcher and, as you can see here, all these app icons there is no app drawer. So all of your apps here are spread across all your home screens and we can talk about whether we like that or not in another video, but that's the way it's set up. So you can tap an app if you want to get into it and it opens right up now. You may have noticed some of the icons are grayed out, so these are the apps that are offline or in the cloud and they're not stored on the device anymore. When you click on them, it takes a minute to download everything in the state you last left. It in and then it opens up right where you left off, and it takes a good second, even on solid Wi-Fi. But this archiving and restoring process is the big selling point for the Robin. Now. If there are apps, you use all the time that you don't want to get archived. You can swipe down on the icon. To pin them pinned apps, never go to the cloud they're pinned on the device forever. Of course, if you're using it all the time, you shouldn't even need to pin them it shouldn't accidentally get archived if you use it a lot but yeah. That'S it. That'S the secret to Robin, never running out of storage. Now, for a $ 400 phone having potentially 132 gigs of storage is cool, but it's also dependent on the internet and buying into that next bit system and I almost wouldn't buy this phone just for this feature. In fact, I buy this phone just for the fact that at its price, it's actually a pretty solid Android smartphone and you can ignore all the next bit stuff and just use it like a normal phone toss on your launcher of choice. You can route it Ramat. The bootloader is actually unlocked out the box and they'll support loading CyanogenMod on it or something, and they still honor the warranty. So this is like a good phone for the price outside of their storage solution. Now, if you were buying a mid-range phone specifically focusing on having lots of storage, I look at something with a micro SD card slot, like maybe the oneplus X, because you can go past 132 gigs. But if that's not hugely important and you're choosing between this and something like Nexus 5x or oneplus 2, it's definitely worth considering this. The build quality is up to par. The specs and performance are pretty solid and the user experience isn't too crazy and obviously you can change it. The way you like it now I'll say this: if this were a normal $ 400 vanilla, Android smartphone with a micro SD card slot, instead of the next bit cloud stuff, it might have been a hit. But it's cool to see this type of cloud-based storage solution. In action props to next bit, I like it thanks for watching guys I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace """
WmhKCq0vfjE,AKG K702 Review: Comfy Headphones!,4:33,"Hey, what's up guys my PhD here and every once in a while, you got to switch it up, which is exactly what I'm doing with headphones again, trying a new pair every once in a while - and this is the most recent pair I gave a shot. These are the AKG K. 702. I promised I didn't pick him up just because of red and black, although that definitely helped. I picked them up because they already kind of have a great reputation. This whole k7 series already has all great reviews and people seem to love them. You keep recommending them to me so when they dropped on mass drop, then yeah, I just totally picked them up and they're quite nice. So these run now right around 250 bucks. Actually, recently, a little less around 230 on Amazon, so they're not cheap and they're, not shy about being reference headphones, which is on the box and on the headphones themselves and in the name. So that's what you got to analyze them, as so, for all intents and purposes, these are a custom colorway of the AKG 702 s and they are a very simple, straightforward pair of open back reference monitors. So what that means is in terms of features. There'S not a whole lot of crazy stuff going on here. I know a lot of consumer headphones like to mess around with you know: bass, ports and dials and adjustable sound. These are just about as simple as it gets just a clean, no frills pair of headphones. The one thing you do have gone for them, though, is comfort. This is one of the most comfortable pairs of headphones. I'Ve ever worn, you kind of feel like you, could wear them for hours and not even notice, you're still wearing them, which is exactly what you want with reference monitor headphones because you'll be wearing them for a long period of time. While you work, the cups are big and they go completely around your ear and then the foam on the inside is this super soft, like almost sort of like a memory foam, so it holds its shape and move slowly doesn't get sweaty like leather, it's nice and Then they're super lightweight. I still do like a little bit of padding on the top of most headphones. These aren't padded, but it saves weight and the mechanism for how adjustable they are is super simple. It'S just really flexible. It slides freely so no notches or anything, and then the headphones can fit all types of head shapes from. You know kids head to a huge head whatever, so you drop it on your head and that thin leather band, just kind of holds it up there and the headphones are light enough. That they're super comfortable, like I said also the earcup foam, is so thick that they prop the actual inside of the headphone completely off your ears. So the inside of the ear cup is just kind of this empty space that the sound seems to come from. It'S more popular with bigger headphones. So with all this talk about the comfort and no frills approach, you're probably wondering how do they sound well? Actually, that's kind of easy. They sound like reference, headphones, they're, very flat, clean, balanced and just a little bit warm the biggest difference. You'Ll actually notice with these and most other pairs of headphones is that they are open back, so soundstage is way wide and the different parts of the track sound. Like they're coming from different parts of the room around you, I did an entire video all about you know, open-back headphones and what those are like. So you can check that out. These fall into that category and another thing since they're open. You all know what that means sound leak, these leak like a lot of sound even more than normal, which I think you know, isn't really a big deal in most situations, if you're using these like in a studio or something, but just something to keep in mind. If you were planning on bringing these to work or something so overall, I was happy with the sound now whether it came from a preamp or my desktop or plugged straight into a laptop. It always gave me that accurate representation of my audio - they might not be the most fun for music listening because they are so flat. I mean even the master op Edition have tuned it up. The bass is bumped by three decibels, but even they still sound pretty flat, so can escape the design and that's basically it so to summarize, what are you getting for your money? You'Re, getting simple headphones, not a whole lot in the way features, but you do get some quality materials. You know some brushed metal plastic up here, some real leather over here and a super comfortable overall package. Thanks to some crafty engineering and I'm thinking, they're pretty durable too so yeah they're, maybe not great - for typical music listening but they're awesome for monitoring, because that's what they're made for and at the end of the day, they're pretty easy to recommend and, like I said, Obviously, there are some others that do the same thing for the same price, but the main advantage of these, I think, is their comfort, so they're worth checking out. I'M glad I found them I'll link to them below and I think they're also $ 1.99. For a couple more days on mass drop, if you want to grab that quick discount, that's been it! Thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace. """
fgK-bxZIG-o,OnePlus X Review!,6:43,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here - and this is the oneplus X, in my opinion, the best really cheap smartphone that you can buy right now and even if you're not going to buy this phone, it's still worth knowing that a phone like this exists. This is one plus is super budget $ 250 smartphone, where the whole point is to give an impressive premium feel in the hand at this low price, and they do this by using materials like metal and glass all the way around, which is awesome. So the flat edges have these ridged metal rails all around the edges are all chamfered and there's this 2.5 D sort of curved glass on the front and the back kind of like the iPhone 4s or the Nexus 4. So in the hand it feels really nice. It has some weight to it. It doesn't Bend at all like some plastics would, but glass is definitely one of the slipperiest materials possible. So even though it feels pretty premium, naked you'll probably want to at least slap a skin on the sky. So I'll drop a link to one of those below that like button and oneplus even includes this clear plastic case with this phone. So they kind of already acknowledged this, and, of course, glass is also a fingerprint magnet in this black color. So there's also a white version available that shows less smudges but beyond materials. This is a classic oneplus piece of hardware, so power button and volume rocker on the right hand, side and the alert slider on the left hand, side really happy to see that there and there is a decent speaker on the bottom. Only the left grill is a speaker and it gets kind of loud, but it definitely distorts at the highest volumes. Now inside you have a similar piece of hardware to, I guess the oneplus one so a Snapdragon 801 Adreno, 330 3 gigabytes of RAM, which has been pretty awesome for a budget phone and right up front. You have a 5-inch, 1080p AMOLED display and I got ta say this is the best feature of the phone. By far I always love OLED displays, and this one is no exception. For me. It'S got inky blacks and the super contrast II really vivid, saturated colors. We love and this one is actually pretty bright too. So that's nice. Usually, you see a big drop-off in the display quality of budget, smart phones, but this display, despite it being a little cooler, color temperature and a lit smaller than most, is legitimately quite nice and then to capitalize on this OLED display. Oneplus has some tweaks in oxygen. Os just for this phone to use black more often, which you might know, saves battery in an OLED. So there's a dark mode going on throughout the OS dark background in the app drawer dark background in the Settings app a darkened panel behind your quick settings and even includes a bunch of new wallpapers featuring pitch black. Although the one I'm using now is not one of the included ones, I'll include that below in case you want to rock it on one of your OLED phones and yeah performance throughout the OS is pretty nice pretty clean and smooth again top notch for a true Budget phone - this is still technically on top of android 5.1. So you'll note that i'm hoping it'll get a marshmallow update soon enough, which will make it an even sweeter deal and oneplus is pretty good about software updates. So, even before you get marshmallow, you get features like control over the app permissions which is built into oxygen. Os and customization features are everywhere. You can change the accent color of the whole OS in this dark mode, so it's cyan by default, but there's a whole bunch of contrast, II, bright presets and you can choose between on screen or off screen buttons, also as you're accustomed to in other oneplus phones. You can use custom, icon packs and you can go through and change all kinds of stuff like the order of the quick settings, toggles and all the stuff in the Shelf panel to the left of your home screens, etc. All this stuff is familiar from more expensive phones like the oneplus 2, and you might not realize it at first, but it's kind of nice to have these usability features and nice to have stuff. Usually, it's stripped down from lower end phones, just to sort of make sure there's a clear distinction, but not so here. This is a very complete software experience really all the same stuff that we love about the oneplus 2 and also battery life battery life was good for me, it's a roughly 2500 million power battery and I was getting around three-and-a-half hours of screen on time. So ending the day with a bit of battery to spare, mostly with brightness in your max and the usual, you know social stuff, watching videos it handled occasional web browsing all that stuff. Fine. I think we can thank the OLED display for a lot of those battery savings, and you can't forget to mention the expandable storage. This one can hold either two SIM cards or one SIM card and one micro SD card and, lastly, the camera. Another area where budget smartphones usually fall off pretty hard. The oneplus X is rocking a 13 megapixel camera with an F 2.2 aperture, and it's actually alright. It relies pretty hard on image processing since there's no Hardware stabilization but photos in normal light. Look nice and pretty much what you would expect from any smartphone decent sharpness, pretty tame colors, though a kind of a weak dynamic range without HDR and then getting into low-light. It doesn't completely break down like some other budget smartphones, but it kind of hangs around which is nice to see and really a lot of the photo taking experience is helped by the fact that the camera app in oxygen OS is so quick and simple. So there's like almost no shutter lag, I really missed a shot with it. Plenty of smart phones in all kinds of budgets really struggle with the camera being slower, but this is definitely not one of them. So, at the end of the day, this is definitely my favorite super inexpensive smartphone coming in at that 250 bucks. But don't get fooled into thinking that this is the complete package. You definitely get what you pay for and to get a smart phone down to a low price like this, as we know with oneplus, you do have to take quite a few shortcuts, and cost-cutting is real, so no NFC in this phone, no 802 dot. 11Ac. Wi-Fi! No 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi no USB type-c, no rapid charging, no wireless charging, no 4k. Video, no o is no raw photos and then one particularly curious omission on the inside no bands, 7 or 12, which will actually affect you a little bit if you're, a t-mobile or AT """
K-jYDRd_53w,Blackberry Priv Review!,8:10,"Hey what is up guys so blackberry doesn't make that many phones anymore, but this is the newest one. It'S called the BlackBerry Prive. This is a smartphone made by blackberry right, but it runs Android. I said before it would take a lot for me to actually review a blackberry, but this one this one's actually not bad, no seriously, it's not bad at all, so right off the top for a blackberry. This phone is quite nice. It'S my favorite blackberry ever, but in the vast array of smartphones out now I'd say it's pretty middle-of-the-road average. First of all, with the build, it's got the quite a few things going for it. Obviously it's a vertical slider, so that's pretty unique as far as smartphones go, but when the keyboard is closed, it's actually pretty clean. The carbon fiber look all the way around the body, the squared off top and bottom, and the texture. The material itself is actually really grippy, both on the back and on the rails on the sides too. So this is the phone that does not need a skin or case. It'S never slid out of my pocket once never slid off a desk. It'S probably the most secure feeling phone I've ever held. It'S got the power button on the left and the trio of buttons on the right, so volume up, volume down and the toggle for volume control reminds me of other blackberries and there's also a front facing speaker. Actually, on the bottom too, now it's really barely an average speaker is pretty weak as far as quality goes, but it's facing the user. So it's still better than anything, rear-facing and then right above that speaker is a lip for you to grab the keyboard and that's where you can slide it open and close with one hand, and I got used to this motion in a matter of minutes and then Over the course of weeks of using the device, it felt correct pretty quickly the spring mechanism for opening it is solid, feels durable and confident when the phone is open and it actually feels more balanced when it's open when the weight is spread out more, it doesn't Feel top-heavy at all my only complaint with the build is the thin back cover material I feel like, since it's sealed in phone, you could use whatever material you want, but the back just feels soft and thin and kind of flexes now on paper again, this is The best blackberry ever snapdragon 808 chip, two gigabytes of ram 32 gigs of internal storage, but that's also expandable. Inside a 3410 milliamp hour battery with wireless charging and quick charging and a 5.4 inch quad HD AMOLED display with slightly curved edges on both sides. Now, among the other top smartphones, it's kind of sitting, mid high-end, but still refreshing to see this in a Blackberry, so the battery life I got was meh decent, like b-minus territory. I was getting barely three hours of screen on time and the screen itself is pretty good, not the best quad HD AMOLED display I've seen which is sort of a weird statement to make now. But it's true and it's still plenty sharp but could be brighter and a bit more saturated, but it's a quality panel and all of this under all the BlackBerry logos and hardware, it runs android 5.1 under the hood and it's actually pretty close to stock android. I wouldn't really call it a skin more of a vanilla Android with a bunch of blackberry, enhancements and added features thrown in kind of like what Motorola does with their Moto X, and this is kind of where blackberry goes to town. They added a ton of stuff mixing in classic older blackberry features with new stuff and Android, so you can swipe up from the bottom to not just get Google now, but also blackberry device, search and blackberry hub. I found Google now does a pretty good job of searching the device anyway, but I didn't use blackberry hub that much because it's sort of overwhelming it's a collection of all of your notifications from email and Twitter etc. Everything shows up there. You can also use icon packs from the Play Store in the custom launcher. It'S not Google launcher, but it's very similar plus this feature, and it also has a feature called pop-up widgets, which lets you swipe up from certain icons on your homescreen to just show their widgets, and this is already sort of a feature in some other third-party Android Launchers, but hey it's built in now here and it's occasionally pretty useful, especially I guess for music and media apps, there's also a redesigned slightly crazy-looking multitasking tray with like different apps of different sizes, not sure why, but that's the way it is, and you also now Have double tap to wake but no double tap to sleep. I always say this: I think every phone that has the option to double tap to wake should also let you double tap to sleep. It also sorts your notifications in the tray, so you can target certain apps when you have multiple notifications from apps and over here on. The side of your curved display is, what's called the productivity tab you swipe in from the side kind of like the tab on the Galaxy s6 edge, and it shows full screen calendar events, contacts tasks, all sorts of stuff. I kind of wish I could throw in some app shortcuts in there, but that would take a software update. It also throws in this sweet charging indicator and ambient display, since it's an AMOLED display, and you can do things without using much battery and pretty much all these new additions are pretty intuitive and clean and easy to figure out. What'S weird, though, is that, despite that, pretty solid set of specs, we talked about this, guy has more hitches than a normal Android phone. I found animations slowing down a bit and dropping a little frames more than I'd want to see out of the Snapdragon 808 device, especially when multitasking and web browsing and switching between a bunch of stuff. It'S funny because gaming and intense stuff was perfectly fine. Graphics held up and it didn't drop any frames. Everything was totally smooth, but for some reason the quicker lighter stuff actually took some hits and it definitely got warm they never overheated or anything, but I could definitely feel it in that fin back after extended use. Now I'm sure software updates, including an update to marshmallow, hopefully, will fix a lot of these issues and even extend battery life a bit with those. But for now that's my experience and then, since it is a Blackberry. After all, there's a little focus on the keyboard and the typing experience, so the software keyboard is pretty good, but if you don't like it like, I didn't you can replace it with the Google keyboard or anything else. If you want it's Android and the hardware keyboard is alright, I'm personally not a huge fan and look. I like hardware keyboards. I started off my smartphone career with the Moto droid. That thing had an awesome keyboard, but the keys were a lot bigger. This blackberry Prive is a vertical slider and all the keys feel tiny and very close together. A little too close for my fingers, but I understand not everyone's hands are huge, so here are some tricks for people who will really use this physical keyboard. So you can swipe left to delete one word at a time. So if you made a typo or something and you just want to delete it, you get the satisfying gesture to get rid of words. And then, if you want to be a little more precise, you can double tap to enter cursor mode and that's just a little little touch on the keyboard. It'S not actually pressing keys. Then it acts like a touchpad. You can actually move around to choose where you want to type, and this touchpad behavior can work in other apps too, so you can scroll through Twitter or Phoenix or Instagram or Chrome or whatever just by swiping along the top of the keyboard, which is pretty cool. Might seem like a gimmick at first, but all this stuff works really well to keep your fingers off the display, so you can see the whole display while you're using it. Alright. Last thing in touch on with this Prive is the camera on the back, probably less important on a blackberry but continuing on the theme it's better than any other blackberry camera. But it's really nothing special. It'S an 18 megapixel shooter with oh, is, and the dual LED flash on the back and it's capable of some pretty mediocre. Looking for K, video and the photos it takes. It has this really steep quality curve from high light to low light in high light. The photos, look, fine, nice and sharp and detailed and have accurate color, not a whole lot of dynamic range and highlights do blow out all the time. But it looks fine, but then very quickly, once you start to lose light, the photos get way worse and every smartphone camera suffers in low-light, but yeah. This one really takes a hit. You get plenty of noise and artifacts and processing just looks a little out of whack here. The camera app itself is really clean, nothing wrong with it, except that it's really slow to actually take a photo. Why is there that much shutter lag? I like that. I have exposure control with a neat little slider down there at the bottom, but yeah the camera app needs an update for a lot of these things to be fixed, oh and the front-facing 2-megapixel camera is a joke. So what do we learn with this phone? Well, BlackBerry has a whole bunch of good ideas, lots of productivity tricks and neat shortcuts, and things like that, but not enough to win me over personally, I used it kind of like a normal Android phone, not a premium blackberry, and it was just alright. You might like it, but I think I'll wait for the prove too thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys, the next one peace you """
Xc5fFvp8le4,Nexus 6P Review!,13:29,"Hey what is up guys, i'm kim Bhd here - and this is the larger of the two brother nexuses that came out this year - Nexus 6p, it's the successor to the Nexus 6 and the P apparently stands for premium, which I think is fitting. This is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year before it came out and after using it for nearly a month, I can say it has live up to a lot of the hype which is hard to do for a smartphone nowadays and quickly become one Of my favorite smartphones right now for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it is a big phone again, it's technically the successor to the huge Nexus 6, but 6p is a little more manageable, with a slightly smaller 5.7 inch display and a thinner, flatter body and, more importantly, flat sides that actually kind of help you, with The grip, a lot there's also three colors graphite, aluminum and frost they're, all the same, feel in the hand, same texture, and I, like this stealth graphite, look personally a bit more. It sort of hides the visor look of the glass up top, but it is the most fingerprint magnet II of any of them. So you might go with the white if you like, the more traditional Nexus look or you could rock a skin which can also look super dope I'll leave a link to this one below but yeah Nexus 6p has a super premium, build all metal all the way Around these chamfered edges and a nice bit of weight to it, and it has this ridged power buttons next to the volume buttons, all of which are relatively clicky and decently tactile and overall, it's definitely fitting in the premium package, with its industrial design and the material Choices, it's top-notch, which is always awesome to see in a nexus the hump on the back of the phone with the camera and the flash and the window for radios to pass through. It'S really not all that bad and it actually spans the whole width of the phone kind of like the Droid X back in the day, so it still sits flat enough on a table to type without rocking. I personally don't mind it and it actually kind of helps tell which side is up when grabbing the phone without looking. The only weird part of the build for me was the bottom back panel, which felt slightly more Ray is on one side than the other, like it kind of didn't quite fit on my review unit Nexus 6p. But my retail units were just fine one of the coolest new pieces of hardware with the new nexuses or is it necks? I I'm I'm gon na go with nexuses. Unless someone from google corrects me one of the coolest new pieces of Nexus hardware, is the fingerprint reader on the back dubbed Nexus imprint, it's really good and knowing how good some of Huawei's other fingerprint readers are. This shouldn't be much of a surprise, but the touch to unlock was really quick with this one and I really got used to it being there on the back of the phone right, where my index finger rests to the point where at reaching in my pocket and Grab the phone with an unlocking grip and that would just be ready to go before I even got it up to my face. So the unlock is just as fast as using a power button here, but obviously way more secure. The only real downside to it being on the back is if your phone's sitting on a table or something you either have to use that pattern unlock, or I guess, pick up the phone to physically unlock it a little less convenient, but I got used to it. Alright, so continuing with the theme of premium up on the front of the sky, you have a beautiful crispy, 5.7 inch, quad HD OLED display this isn't a huge upgrade on paper. Nexus 6 had a quad HD OLED display too, but this one is slightly better slightly brighter slightly less pink at low brightness, which is a nice improvement, slightly better viewing angles before rainbows out and slightly more accurate color. It still. Pops like an AMOLED should but color accuracy is tight with this one. It'S a latest generation samsung panel, so it should be. I put this display right up near the top for any smartphone short of the galaxy note 5, which seemed to get really bright but overall thumbs up for the screen on the Nexus 6p on the wallpaper link is right below that. Like button you're welcome. Now you probably already noticed that the display is flanked by a pair of front-facing stereo speakers, they're outstanding speakers really big loud crisp, full sound, easily comparable to like boom sound from an HTC One m9 or Moto X, pure speakers. I said it before this makes for an awesome music. Listening experience, awesome video watching awesome gaming, awesome conference calls awesome alarm, clock everything sounds great coming from this phone and that can't be overlooked. I love them now. This is still a really high-end phone in the specs Department, as it should be for the price so inside you're getting a snapdragon 8 ten version, 2.1 ship, the audrina 430 GPU, three gigabytes of ram and either 32 64 or if your ball or 128 gigabytes of Storage and these high-end specs paired with the latest version of android 6.0 marshmallow, translates into a really smooth experience from top to bottom front. To back inside out using this phone is awesome, it's extremely responsive and snappy, and it handles pretty much everything. I'Ve tried it like a champ and look. I throw a lot at phones, especially when I'm testing them, so I noticed when they hang up or when I stutter or when they start to slow down or when they can't quite push all their pixels and a month. In this nexus, very rarely hiccups over much of anything. The one thing it's a cupped over the most is probably the camera app which I'll get to in a second but everything else. Multitasking opening and closing apps web browsing all that fun stuff. Buttery gaming has been great, I know, there's been, you know the concern over the Snapdragon 810 chip, but I have no problems with them using it here, because this phone only gets a little bit warm, maybe sometimes now the heat dispersion is great with the metal body And performance has been consistent and clean and smooth. I have no complaints with that so yeah without any worries about performance, you're kind of just your freedom mess around in the newest version of Android, without worries of anything hanging up and marshmallow has been pretty great. So far, right out the box, there are less pre-installed apps, so you have the option to install most of Google's stuff from the Play Store and I've always been a fan of clean stock Android. A lot of it is for aesthetic reasons, but it's getting a lot of functionality. Improvements too, and this is the stuff that you see trickle down into other non Nexus phones later down the road classic example. Brand new Android 6.0 feature Google now on tap. So you still have the Google now cards, but Google now on tap is a sort of a next level of convenience to accessing quick information. Basically, it reads: what's on your display, whatever is text and when you press and hold the home button after that animation and about three or four seconds of loading, it brings up some cards related to. What'S on the screen, linking you to more information about it. So, for example, I'm on someone's tweet here I hold home to see what's now on tap, give it a few seconds and it recognizes the person who tweeted and the stuff that they tweeted about. So then I can go grab a link to go get more info. This can be useful in like a text conversation. Maybe someone mentions a restaurant on now on, tap can bring more info about it. Show you a menu, give you a phone number to call and make a reservation, or maybe someone mentions a movie, and you want to see the channel trailer real, quick, just neat little things that can save you a bunch of taps. If you know when to use it, but the thing is it's really inconsistent right now, sometimes I hold down and there's nothing on tap. Even when I was hoping to see something specific and other times. I actually tried now on tap twice with the exact same thing. On my screen and one time it gave me interstellar and the Martian and the next time it gave me interstellar the Martian and Matt Damon. I'M not really sure why I got that the second time, not the first but yeah now on tap. You can definitely tell it's young it's early, it has room to grow. I feel like it's in a year or two it'll be much faster and much more consistent and useful, as it evolved kind of reminds me of the early days of Google. Now, when it didn't have nearly as many cards and yes, you can still access Google now cards by holding down the home button and hitting the Google G at the bottom, it's always there, just one extra tap to get into it. I kind of miss just swiping up from the home button, but yeah outside of that. There are plenty of other little new features here and there in Android 6.0 the new share card, with your most frequent contacts up at the top, the new launcher, with your most frequent apps during certain times of the day. Also up at the top, the new permissions manager is also much more powerful. You can grant or remove any permissions from any app at the drop of a hat if you wanted to which puts all the power in the users hands there and, of course, the battery optimizations on an app by app basis as well. The battery life on the Nexus 6p has been pretty damn good. We all know it has a 34 50 million power battery so even in such a thin form factor a pretty sizable battery, but with a quad HD display and all these high-end internals, you don't expect it to get the longest battery life ever, but it does pretty Well, I've gotten somewhere between three and three-quarters, to four and a half hours of screen on time, which in my book is like an AAA, especially for a phone of this size, but it's not the screen on time. That'S so impressive about this phone. It'S the standby time. One of the news features in Android 6.0 marshmallow is called doze, which essentially is using the sensors to recognize when the phone is not being used. Sometimes it's facedown on a table or it's in a bag or something for a while. So the phone will refresh things in the background more slowly, less often to save battery the result. Is these new phones barely sip any our in standby mode, which is awesome? You can forget to charge your phone with 50 % at night and wake up the next day with 48 % and lit lighter days where you don't use the phone a lot. You can end the day with 30, sometimes 40 or more percent battery left, because you can see in the battery charts where was dozing and saving a ton of power which is pretty legit. On top of that, this is a phone with USB type-c, as you probably saw in the unboxing and supports fast charging. So you can get something like six or seven hours of use out of a quick, 10 minute charge. No wireless charging here, which is a bit of a bummer for some people, but I always prefer quick charging. If I have the choice now, there's one last big change with these new nexuses that a lot of people, including me, were curious about and that's the camera. Nexus 6p is rocking a new 12 megapixel Sony sensor, no optical image stabilization, but an F 2.0 aperture laser autofocus and a really large pixel size. Apparently this was a sensor originally designed for point shoots, not smartphone cameras. So that's cool. Here'S what's good with the camera. It'S pretty solid, definitely way better than any Nexus camera in the past. Although that's not a super high bar to clear and you can double tap the power button from anywhere, including the lock screen to launch the new Google camera app and its overall quite fast to snap pictures, which gives you a certain confidence when shooting a photo that You'Re going to get it also, I noticed it's a particularly wide angle lens on the back facing camera and the photos themselves. Look quite nice, there's a full size photo gallery on mkbhd comm linked below. If you want to check out those full size images, but here on YouTube, you can see you're getting pretty sharp photos plenty of detail in those 12 megapixels, not too saturated, but nice color and overall, pretty good looking. It does have a tendency to overexpose, though, and dynamic range is probably the biggest weakness. It'S not terrible, but you definitely do get blown out highlights pretty frequently, even if you tap to expose the right place. Most of my photos never had any problems on the shadows, but highlights got blown out all the time. Of course, a natural way to fix this is to turn on hdr, and I did that it worked and you can see before HDR the highlights are blown out and after HDR you get your highlights back. So it works like it should once you get in low-light Nexus, 6p photos start to show some grain as you'd expect, but they stay surprisingly blur-free for something without optical image, stabilization and basically, what it's doing here is cranking the iso way up and keeping a relatively Fast shutter speed to compensate for the lack of stabilization and then relying on really heavy image processing to get rid of the noise from such a high ISO. You can see in these low-light photos. Some areas get really soft because of all the noise removal turns out again. The best trick for all this at night is to use hdr again takes a little bit slower, but the photo once it processes looks a lot better check it out, regular, shot, hdr, regular, shot, HDR plus it's definitely. It works. It'S keeping a more natural and lively tone for those low-light shots and does better with noise. Overall, you can tell the camera, and the Nexus 6p is really not bad. I think the area where it hurts the most from no OIS is in the 4k video, where those tiny little shakes from a handheld shot are normally smoothed out. Not so this time around. But outside of that, you can really tell Google's put a lot of work into the stock Google camera to make image processing better, not overly sharp or overly processed, but pretty natural-looking, and while there's no raw or manual modes with the new camera app, you can actually Do that stuff, with a third-party app, so at the end of the day, Nexus 6p checks a lot of boxes. For me, in terms of what I want in a phone, I've talked about how before there's basically no perfect smartphone and there's still one or two or three things that I would have liked to have seen in this Nexus. But as far as Android phones go. This is my new favorite. This is easy, a daily driver pic for me and I really like using as far as recommending it goes. I think this is one of the easiest Nexus phones ever for me to recommend to someone to buy, especially with the much improved camera the great battery life and just an overall awesome experience throughout fast fingerprint reader, great display and awesome performance throughout the clean bloat free Stock Android, so if you're an Android thighs'ya store a smartphone enthusiast, you're pretty much good to go. This is a smartphone. That'S not going to disappoint you at all in pretty much any way and if you're just getting into smartphones or just getting into this budget of a smartphone, I still think it's going to be a great smartphone buy, especially because you'll be right up at the front Of the tr4 new Android updates and new features and new things that come along with what Google tosses in so uh yeah highly recommended good stuff.

2IIUHleexIk,Moto 360 V2 Review!,3:57,"Hey so I was just getting some work done the other day and I was wearing the Moto 360 that day and I got a quick email notification didn't respond to. It didn't even have to take out my phone and I thought yeah - that's neat, but then I realized I haven't reviewed this yet so let's do that real, quick! This is the new Moto 360. I don't know what it is about this 360, but I keep coming back to it as my sort of de facto SmartWatch. Obviously, the competition has gotten way better since the first one, but still give it credit for sort of starting the circular revolution we see today and a focus on design anyway. This 2015 Moto 360 is a really minor upgrade from the original and pretty much every way. So it'll look familiar here is everything that's new number one, the design? Okay, not really it's pretty much the same design, but you do get a couple improvements here and there, the lugs that connect the watch to the bands are for one much easier to remove quickly. So interchangeable bands are much easier. Now I have the leather one that it came with. You can see just by removing both of them. It will be easy to change to whatever other ones you buy, and I now have some texture in the bezel of mine. Here. You can see, which is because I chose that in Moto maker. This is actually the best new feature. The Smart Watch compared to the competition the ability to build your own with any combination of the band and body colors and bezels, built to order right out the box, so you can build a pretty dope combo to your liking. I went with a pretty clean all-black. Look as you can see pretty toned down, but that's my choice and actually think having a black bezel sort of blends in with the display. More and with the black watch face that also kind of hides the bar at the bottom, which still holds the ambient light sensor and display drivers you pretty much get used to it being there alright number two new thing is the specs one of the biggest concerns With the first moto 360, if you remember, was the slower, outdated, OMAP chip, they gave it so this new one is now rocking literally a quad-core Snapdragon 400 new GPU and half a gig of ram, so that concern is pretty much wiped and performance is consistently pretty Smooth on the Moto 360, interestingly, it's not the smoothest performance. I'Ve seen in any SmartWatch, though I'd still give that edge to stuff like the Apple watch and even Samsung's gear s2, just as far as pure smoothness of graphics goes, but among android wear smartwatches. This is pretty much as good as it gets now. Here'S an interesting thing, the ambient mode that leaves the display on and dim forever is turned on by default. When you get the new 360, which you would think with a small battery on a SmartWatch and an LCD display, not an OLED like the Huawei watch, you'd think that would kill the battery life. But it has easily made it through a full day for me, usually with more than 30 % left with ambient mode on. So if you turn ambient mode off and let the display fully sleep in between waking it, this thing can go full two days between charges, which is a nice improvement and the best part is since it's a small battery. If you ever find yourself low on a charge, the wireless charging is really fast, so you can juice up in under an hour from being dead. So you know I just left ambient mode on. The only weird thing I noticed is some watch faces overlaps with notification text while its ambient, but that never mattered, because when I light it up and look at it, everything snaps into place and into color. This is definitely a better experience than the first mode of 360. It even actually works with the iPhone now, despite you know, much more limited control over how notifications work on iOS, technically, though, that also makes it a competitor to the Apple watch for some buyers. Bottom line, though I'm less of a SmartWatch guy than I was about a year ago. I don't wear one every day anymore, but it's nice to see improvements in these neat little pocket computers that you can put on your wrist, especially in design we might be asking if it's worth upgrading over the old one. I would say yes, even if only for that improved battery and performance, but the competition has gotten a lot better. So look out for a roundup video of the best wearables that you can get this year either way. Thank you for watching this one and I'll talk to you guys in the next video peace you """
E357cGzOGLM,iPhone 6s Review!,10:06,"Hey, what's up guys, I'm Kim PhD here, and this is the iPhone 6s now I know it might be a little bit hard to tell the difference between the 6 and the 6s at first glance. So this video is everything you need to know. That is new and different about the iPhone 6s. First of all, the design so on the outside, the design remains nearly the same, not identical, but obviously super familiar for iPhone 6 users for those of Hawkeye's know notice. The iPhone 6 has all the FCC markings on the bottom and no S badge. Then the 6s came out after you are no longer required to have the FCC marking, so they got rid of them and it looks a little bit cleaner. Though the S badge, I guess, looks a little bit out of place anyway. The main way you'll actually be able to tell if someone has the new iPhone is if they have the new pink color, you mean rose gold right, it's it's pink, so dude, it's rose. Gold, it's like a pale faded version. It'S rose gold. Alright, it's rose gold anyway. The real difference on the outside is that Apple's now using a 7000 series aluminum, which makes for a stronger body, which means it won't bend as easily it's even reinforced internally around the volume buttons where it bent last year. You can't see that, but it's there. Overall, though, button placement, headphone jack, mute, switch, etc, all the stuff is in the same place, it's still also the rounded shape of last year, and I've said this before the rounded sides make it a bit slippery in the hand, so you already know what to do. Although something to note this new iPhone is thicker taller and wider than the iPhone 6, so your cases and skins from last year probably won't fit depending on how precise they are. One of my favorite changes, though, on the front of the new iPhone, is a new touch ID. This new fingerprint sensor is ridiculously fast, some might even say too fast. It'S fast to the point where, if you wake up your phone and unlock it with your finger on the home button, you might actually miss the notifications that you could have read on your lock screen, which is pretty funny, because you can basically unlock touch ID with Just a tap now in not holding the home button, you can just touch it and it will read your fingerprint and that fast, the workaround, of course, to not being able to read our notifications or just check. The time would be to use a different finger to check that or resort back to that trusty sleep/wake button. So the next big upgrade with the iPhone 6s is on the inside the specs. So when the 3GS first came Apple said the S stood for speed. Technically we haven't said anything since then, so I'm just gon na assume the S again stands for speed, because this phone is insanely fast. It'S rockin Apple's new a9 chip, technically a dual-core chip, but two very powerful cores near cue, gigahertz and two gigabytes of RAM, which is plenty for iOS. As we know so. Multitasking is great. It keeps more apps in memory now longer than they did before, and overall day to day performance is super. Snappy frame rates are consistently high up and using this phone for weeks. So it's not just a brand new phone being fast, apps, open and close, really quickly and performance throughout is top notch. Now the 6s dropped some insane scores too in Geekbench on par with some laptops. So if that gives you any idea, this phone is blaze. Now there is one speck, that's actually technically worse than it was before, and that's the battery on paper. You actually have technically a slightly smaller battery in these new iPhones than you did in the previous, so the iPhone 6s is down to 1715 milliamp hours and the iPhone 6s plus down to 2750. The battery life, however, is still about the same meaning. The iPhone 6s battery is okay, it'll, probably last you a full day normally, but heavy days you might find yourself needing to plug in before the end of the day, but the iPhone 6s plus battery is really good. That'S one of the benefits of a bigger phone. The 6s plus is one of the best battery lives in any smartphone. It has awesome standby time, meaning you can forget to charge it at night and not have any worries and I failed to kill it in a day. So I'm more than happy at the end of day ending with twenty to thirty percent battery life, even after normal or heavy use. Now the next main thing that's changed in the iPhone 6s is the display. Now the panel itself is still the same. It'Ll still look the same: a 1334 by 750 IPS panel on the iPhone 6s and a 1080p LCD on the 6s plus. But the display now has some extra hardware to make it pressure. Sensitive Apple calls, it 3d touch and it's basically the iPhones biggest new feature. Now it's called 3d touch, not forced touch, because it has multiple layers of pressure, sensitivity and that's what allows for what Apple calls peek and pop. Nobody actually calls it that, but that's what Apple's naming it so, when an app that supports 3d touch. If you see something you like, you can press into it with a bit of pressure to peek to see what it is and if you like what you see, you can press even harder to pop into that thing to view it fullscreen and that's the essence of Peek and pop it's not just a long-press, so you can actually peek into something and then decide. That'S all you want to see and then you can release it to minimize it back. You can also 3d touch on the home screen, so apps that support it will reveal Oh quick shortcuts to functions inside them when you press with some pressure and a couple of Apple apps support this to start a few third-party ones are doing this too, and with A little practice you can kind of get to remembering where certain functions are in a shortcut, so you can actually get it to do what you want to do a little bit quicker. It works pretty well now, but we have to remember this is still pretty early for the new iPhones and a lot of the apps that we use today aren't supported by 3d. Touch. Developers, however, are getting on that and when developers build in 3d touch functionality in a meaningful way into their apps it'll start to build out and it'll be a lot more prevalent throughout the whole OS. So again, right now, when it's early, it seems a little bit excessive, like gimmicky, but it'll become very important in the future when an app isn't supported and you try to 3d touch the icon on the home screen. For example, the new haptic engine gives you this quick triple buzz and it blurs the edges, letting you know there's nothing to see here. So you kind of figure out which apps have 3d touch functionality and which don't, in a matter of just going around and pressing. All the apps on your home screen until you find the good ones. Overall, I think 3d touch is pretty cool, but again it will only get cooler in time thanks to developers. So the last but not least, new fing, on the iPhone 6s is the camera. The phone is rocking a new 12 megapixel sensor same flash and mostly the same optics and everything just a new sensor with the new specs to back it up. I have taken a lot of photos with my iPhone 6s plus, partly because you know I'm testing it and it's a new camera, but also because iPhones consistently like encourage taking photos. The camera interface has been some of the best balances of control and ease of use. In any smartphone, in my opinion, so I love the app and it's super fast and responsive and easy to take a great photo so iPhone 6s plus also benefits from having optical image stabilization. So low-light photos are a little bit cleaner and video looks a lot smoother. So here are the photos and honestly you're not going to notice like a whole ton of difference in detail getting 12 megapixels versus 8, but most of the improvements are going to notice. I actually see in the colors and the image processing not a whole lot of sharpening going on, but there's still plenty of detail throughout the frames and you'll probably notice. Colors are kind of warm throughout like every scene and that's actually pretty napped and a good representation of the actual subject, as opposed to sort of cooling off the colors, which might look a little better at first but is less accurate. It handles exposure, great and dynamic range is pretty good, since HDR is never really too aggressive. Since its auto HDR and same thing in low light, you start to see a little bit of noise, as you would expect, but overall, nothing too crazy. Here and again, this is pretty much all just walk up to the subject. Point and shoot now. Jumping from 8 megapixels to 12 now means the iPhone. Finally has enough pixels to shoot that 4k video, I love so much, and the video from the sensor is beautiful. As expected, now, if you're serious about shooting a lot of video on the iPhone, you pretty much have to go 6s plus to get that optical image. Stabilization, but yeah. More of the same characteristics show up here, detail without being overly sharp and great exposure and dynamic range, while not blowing things out and accurate colors with warm tones all the way through, there's also a new feature in the camera. This year called live photos and I've tried really really hard to give this a chance and see if it's not a gimmick, but it kind of is basically live. Photos which are enabled by default captures one and a half seconds before and one and a half seconds after you press the shutter button for every picture and you can even see the live indicator while you're capturing after you hit the shutter button. So you can sort of view that short jiff with sound by 3d touching the photo you just took and seeing the lead-up to the shot and then what happened right after it can be cool every once in a while, like being able to see something blowing in The wind or capturing the lead-up to a photo or what happened right after you click the shutter. I don't know my wife photos would probably be a little more interesting if I was taking pictures of more dynamic things like people, but instead most of mine are just picking the camera up and then putting the camera back down, usually back into my pocket. So, there's an update coming to prevent this from happening by having the iPhone read the accelerometer and gyroscope to know when you stop holding your phone up, but yeah, that's pretty much it for live photos there's no way to share them. You just share the normal picture, and all you have to do with them is set them as your wallpaper or make them your Apple watch face. Basically, I've come to the conclusion that live photos are just a really big, beautiful demo for 3d touch and that's fine. It'S enabled by default they take up the space of two photo instead of one, so not a big deal with storage and the only way to view them is with a 3d touch, so learn it 3d touch is going to be important really soon. That'S it! That'S everything: that's new with the new iPhone 6s it's running iOS 9 and if you're already using a previous iPhone, you're, probably already very familiar with iOS 9. So I don't need to tell you about the slightly new font or the slightly worse, multitasking carousel. In my opinion, you're already familiar with the experience, if you're not coming from an iPhone, you might be interested in the 6s for its blazing fast performance and ease of use and awesome camera. My biggest problem with it is 16 gigabytes really with 4k video and live photos, and everything like that. Honestly, it's 2015 we're pretty much done with that. 16 gig phones need to die and it's not just Apple. Everyone stopped it anyway, that's been it. I guess let the hype train begin for the iPhone 7. Thank you for watching this review video. If you enjoyed, it feel free to hit that like button down below and if you have any comments or questions I'll, be hanging out in the comment section below and we can chat there as well. Thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys, the next one peace """
gM_gTtll7FE,Moto X Pure (2015) Review!,7:58,"Hey what is up guys, I'm Kim PhD here - and this is the 2015 Moto X, pure addition or Moto X style, depending on where you live. So this is, it is the new Moto X. Of course, it looks very familiar to last year because it shares the same body style of the 2014 phone which you can tell by the build materials, the metal rails, the antenna bands and the unmistakable curves. So what is new? First of all, it's a little bit bigger again and it gets a new backplate design still with a dimple which is pretty nice for holding it, but a bit more narrow and also still totally customizable in moto maker, and there are also some new back materials. So I went with this rubberized back on the base model and while you can opt to go with like a wood or a leather on the back, if you do stick with this rubber option, you pretty much don't need any cases or skins with this phone. It is one of the grippy ax stones out there, which makes it really easy to hold, despite being bigger, there's also now a combo nano SIM tray and micro SD card slot up top for expandable storage, and you still get the same button placement and the same Ridged power button from before up front are the biggest improvements, though one a quad, HD IPS display and two stereo speakers again so last year. For some reason, the Moto X switched back to speaker only on the top and not at the bottom. So this year we get that stereo upgrade back and they're right up there as the best sounding speakers in any smartphone, nice and loud and front facing right next to HTC ones. Boom sound alarm clocks are super loud notification, sounds and music get really loud with very little distortion and watching videos and gaming gives you that stereo audio experience again as things move across the display, which is really awesome. You simply can't do that without stereo speakers. Now the back again on the Moto X is non removable, so you don't have access to the battery, but you do get turbo charging and again I'm a really big fan of fast charging and smart phones. I'Ve talked about them past. The phone itself already has a pretty decent battery life as I'll talk about in a second, but the ability to just like plug in for a few minutes at a massive amount of charge is super useful, even if the phone does last pretty much all day now Inside you will find some pretty high-end specs, the Snapdragon 808 chip, the Adreno 418 GPU and three bytes of RAM now. One thing - that's really easy to forget about this Moto X, pure, is how much it costs now. Some of it is because of the similarities and build with last year, but this is now technically a sub $ 400, our phone totally off-contract and that's really impressive. Now, that's sort of blurring a line between these flagships that are six seven hundred dollars and the more budget phones like the oneplus, 2 or phones even lower price. But this still is technically the highest end flagship. That Motorola makes so it's really impressive that they can get all this in such an inexpensive body. This is the best smartphone you can get for under 400 bucks. Now, arguably, the biggest change for this new Moto X is moving from last year's 1080p LED display to this year's quad HD IPS LCD display. So this is an interesting choice for a couple reasons on the panel itself. You know viewing angles are pretty good and it's overall, a pretty nice bright, crispy display. My only technical complaint would be it's not quite as bright as others in high outdoor lights, so not quite readable, and it doesn't get quite as dim either in the lowest of low light. I really do miss the AMOLED display of last year's Moto X, though they switch to IPS LCD and I'm coming from. You know a Samsung phone, for example, with a super high-end quad HD Super AMOLED display and, of course, this by comparison with a much more expensive phone, doesn't look quite as good, but again it's a 400 ollar phone and it's pretty great for what you're getting that Being said, an IPS display versus AMOLED, you still have to light all of the pixels when you're, showing things like your active display notifications, which means at night you'll, see the entire panel sort of light up a little bit just to show that I haven't found. It has a major effect on battery, but I still would have liked to have seen an AMOLED display in this new Moto X. Now the other biggest change here with this phone is the brand new 21 megapixel Sony camera sensor. The camera in the smartphone is also, as Motorola's claimed, much improved from the last version. It'S definitely now way better than any other Motorola smartphone camera in the past, which is great, but despite being 21 megapixels, it's not quite measuring up to the super high-end flagship phones that are six seven eight hundred dollars. This is a prime example of in a camera. More megapixels doesn't necessarily mean better outdoors. The photos can look really nice from the Moto X, of course, with great sharpness and detail and decent color and dynamic range. I like that. It'S not too aggressive with the sharpening, like you might find from a Samsung camera, but you still get plenty of detail. There is no optical image stabilization though so, once you get into out so great light or not ideal conditions, the photos break down pretty quickly, and you also become more aware of the limited dynamic range bottom line. Is this isn't the first phone I would choose? If I was looking to take a lot of great photos or videos, but it's enough of an improvement that it's good enough for most people, my biggest complaint about the camera now is actually the software. I'M really not a big fan of the Motorola camera app. They try to keep it super simple, with the menus sort of tucked away on the left and one giant shutter button with the whole viewfinder, and I guess I'm okay with it now, because I've learned it, but I still don't like tapping the whole viewfinder to take A photo and having to drag around the focus indicator to focus, I think tap to focus is much more intuitive and a shutter button would be really welcome anyway, outside of those things, the camera and the speakers and the display and the new specs. The rest of this phone is very similar to last year's Moto X, which is actually a really good thing. The software experience is largely the same as last year, which is to say near stock android 5.1, with a few Motorola additions in useful places. You get that Moto app, which is housing most of the Moto magic, and a lot of its functions continue to get updated through the Play Store. So it gets better over time and you can use moto actions to double chop to turn on the flashlight that one's new. You can also double twist to open the camera quickly, which means I don't need a camera shortcut on my homescreen anywhere and you still have infrared sensors to let you wave over the phone to see your notification preview in moto display and there's more stuff like this. All over the place that can be added as it gets to learn your behavior and I kept noticing overall performance as an ear stock. Android phone throughout this guy is really good. It'S one of these smoothest, quad, HD phones, I've used I'd, say just as smooth as something like galaxy, s6 or note 5 through every day, performance and multitasking. Despite having a gig less of RAM and a different ship battery life was also very solid. It typically made it to the end of the day for me, which is a nice change from some other phones. I'Ve been testing recently but yeah. It approach four hours of screen on time by the end of the day, no problem and if I had a heavy day with like a lot of navigation or a lot of gaming or something I'm usually near a power source. So quick charging pretty consistently save the day. So, at the end of the day, like I've said, the Moto X, pier, is definitely going to give you the best multimedia experience on any smartphone under 400 bucks, and it's also likely one of the best overall experiences in this budget. It'S near stock Android. So it's probably going to get updates very quickly and I'd expect marshmallow on this guy, pretty soon, of course, being just south of 400 bucks. It'S often going to be compared to the oneplus 2, also just south, to 400 bucks. I would give the multimedia experience edge, like I said, to the Moto X peer, better higher resolution display front-facing speakers and a slightly better camera, despite not having optical image stabilization, but if you're more into the software customization experience. This is going to be your edge here, plus. It has, in my opinion, a little bit better, build quality and you get things like a fingerprint reader and the alert slider on the side. Little bonuses, like the interchangeable back then again, moto maker over here, you can make this point, look exactly the way you want it to either way I'll leave the link to the oneplus 2 review down below. If you want to check that out - and that's been it for the Moto X pure, thank you for watching this review, video guys and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace. """
V-nBAcr_huw,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Review!,9:08,"Hey, what is up guys, I'm qHD here - and this is the Galaxy Note 5, so the latest and greatest from the big smartphone lineup from Samsung. So with this latest in the note series, most of the biggest changes and most of the new stuff with this phone is just on the outside its with the new design language, the new look of the hardware and just how different it looks and feels than the Last note: we now have an all metal and glass phone on the outside, so chamfered metal rails on the sides of the phone and 10 of bands on the top and the bottom and curved all glass back. That'S both much prettier, but also potentially much uglier. When you inevitably get a bunch of fingerprints on it, this thing is a fingerprint magnet it's available in four colors sapphire blueish, the gold, a white and my personal favorite, the titanium gray, since it shows the least fingerprints and you're probably noticing it's taken. A lot of this design language from its little brother of the galaxy s6, so steel back, no removable or expandable anything thin metal edges to hold on to and now with its larger size. I think the galaxy note 5 takes a crown for the slipperiest phone of all time, both in the hand and in the pocket. I swear it's slipped out of my pocket in cars, more than any other phone, and it's like a bar so sometimes trying to pick it up. It'S crazy. This is definitely one of those phones where you're, probably gon na, want to change the texture on the back, to make it easier to hold or to hide fingerprints. So a lot of people might think about buying a case for the zone, but it's already such a big phone that you probably don't want it to be even bigger in the hand. So the easiest way to change the texture, but without adding bulk, would be a skin I'll leave a link to the skins that I like to use from deep brand right below that. Like button, you can pick both the texture and a new color if you want but yeah. So this is the look of a samsung flagship, now shiny glossy and ultimately more premium. Looking. I also like that they kept working on footprint, so the Galaxy Note 5 is actually a bit smaller than the note 4, thanks to a very thin side. Bezel and other things like you know, the headphone, jack placement and the fingerprint sensor and the buttons are all excellent. The buttons like the galaxy s6 are super clicky and tactile and satisfying and easy to press. There are definitely still constant. This new design, though one there's no IR blaster anymore, not sure why I didn't really use the one on the note 4, a ton, but it was nice to have, but then 2 """
s8Un0XB_8xk,OnePlus 2 Review!,13:59,"Hey, what is up guys? Um could be HD here, and this is the oneplus 2 company named oneplus phone name, the 2 1. 2. 1 2. So i've been using this device for the better part of a month about three weeks or so as my daily driver. So all the time - and I know a lot of people - get worked up over the flagship killer slogan that they use. What I'm just going to do is ignore all the hype and just look at the device itself, so the easiest place to start is the hardware and a lot of interesting decisions went into the hardware department for the oneplus 2, but they all came together to equal. A really nice phone that feels good in the hand and that's what's important, so it has a nice little weight to it. It'S a little on the bigger side of the scale as far as smartphones go, but it's nothing too extreme, since it's definitely not the biggest smartphone. With a 5.5 inch display, the metal band around the phone is really premium. It'S a huge improvement over the oneplus one, and it's this metal band alone that makes the phone feel like it's more expensive and I like, if they didn't, try to go super thin, like some manufacturers trying to one-up themselves, I guess but nothing wrong with being a Little thick dear, every smartphone manufacturer, ever if you're, using a large camera module, which you probably are feel free to fill out the rest of the phone's body with battery like this, it will not make the phone too heavy or too thick, and everyone will appreciate the Extra battery, thank you anyway. The shape with the oneplus 2 is just fine. It'S rectangular and sort of boxy in a way, but it fits in the hand nicely, and this phone is really easy to hold the sandstone black back, helps that too now every one plus two comes by default with this sandstone black back and the texture is pretty Unique it's a little bit rougher than last year's phone, I'm guessing for durability, but it still feels great and then the back is removable. So you can buy another back with a different material and drop that on for a different look and feel also with the removable back. You get access to the dual SIM card slot trays. No, I access to the battery or any expandable storage, but you do just get the SIM card slots now. This one also features a pretty unique switch on the left hand side, it's the alert slider, so you can switch between sound profiles on the phone without having to turn the screen on. So all the way down is all notifications. Half way up is priority. Notifications and all the way up is do not disturb mode pretty nifty switch, although I feel like this is upside down. If I wanted to flip all the way to silent, I feel like I would switch all the way down. I don't know I wish I could reverse the order in the settings now. Of course, this slider on the left means you have both your power and volume buttons on the right hand, side of the phone. This was a little bit annoying at first, neither one of them has ridges or anything. So you kind of just have to remember where the power button is, and you get used to it eventually. They'Re, pretty clicky tactile buttons, but it took about a week of using the phone to get it to feel natural and stop making mistakes. I pretty much hit the power button on the first try every time now, although there's also totally the option of the double tap on the screen to wake from sleep. If you want to use that now at the top of the phone is the headphone jack I kind of wish it was at the bottom, but oh well and then at the bottom of the phone you have the speakers and the USB type-c port. Now the speakers aren't anything special, it's not even a stereo speaker. All the audio comes from the right Grill, which is not very loud, and it's kind of easy to cover with your finger. It has these built-in audio profiles, which are nice. If you really want to tweak the EQs, but honestly, the quality of the driver has to be decent first I'll end up cupping your hand around that to hear it anyway. This is one of those spots where they're cutting corners and then there's a USB type-c port. Alright, so this is a new port for smartphones and it was given in this phone with the reasoning. This is the future and it totally is. But that means that here in the present it's actually a little bit inconvenient unless you have a 2015 MacBook or Chromebook pixel, you don't really have a bunch of USB type-c charges lying around and the one that comes on the box. The cable is a little bit short and you have to buy another one for your car and - and I don't know, is it really worth it? Here'S USB type-c in this phone broken down here are your pros, and here are your cons is a worth. It depends on how into the future. You are, I kind of miss fast charging, but the battery life here is good enough that I'm not charging in the middle of the day, so I'm down with it. The oneplus 2 also has a biometric fingerprint sensor in that home button and, as I mentioned in the original impressions, video that I did when the phone first came out, this home button does all the same stuff. A regular home button does except actually press down and move, it's not tactile. So it's basically like a trackpad, a glass surface that you can tap double tap or hold down to read your fingerprint and the fingerprint reading is pretty good. Now this phone has gotten. I think for software updates, since I first started using it and from the very beginning the fingerprint sensor was quick and it's only gotten quicker. I'M really happy with it. It unlocks my phone with pretty great accuracy. You can store up to 5 fingers if you want and it's an easy way to secure my phone. I find it to be just as accurate as touch ID all right, so fun fact. When oneplus first sent me this phone early before the launch day for that impressions, video you guys saw, they didn't tell me anything about the phone, they didn't tell me any of the specs. They didn't tell me any numbers, so I actually wanted to play a little game with myself. I just looked at the display and I wanted to see if I could figure out if it's a 1080p display or a quad HD display, just by looking at it, and I looked at it, I set my wallpaper. I got my icons and everything - and I guessed based on you know, looks pretty good. I'M gon na say that's a top notch yeah, that's that's a quad HD display. Of course I took a screenshot and I looked at it later and it's 1080p. So I got the idea and I you know I held it up to a Galaxy s6 and then, of course you can tell oh that looks way better with the AMOLED display and quad HD on the galaxy s6. But the point is this: is a great 1080p display one of the best in the business and that's pretty good for 2015, so there you have it just on the outside. This phone is kind of stacked in the hardware department. It'S at 5.5 inch 1080p display its excellent has great viewing angles: excellent brightness contrast and colors thin bezels to keep the footprint pretty manageable metal rails. The swappable sandstone back dual SIM card slots, a 13 megapixel camera with autofocus laser autofocus, which I'll talk about in a second at 3300 milliamp hour battery a fingerprint reader and alert slider, a USB type-c port. That'S a lot of great stuff, but, like I mentioned in that perfect smartphone video, the last video we tend to now measure smartphones by what's wrong with them, instead of what's right, so the worst parts about this hardware would be the weak speaker and the lack of Wireless charging and NFC now on the weak speaker, not a whole lot. You can do you can just set the EQ still. It sounds good enough to your ear and it just won't be very loud and the wireless charging also not a huge deal for me. If you can pick up a few USB type-c cables, you'll pretty much be good to charge wherever you want. No NFC, though, there's really no workaround for that and there's two types of people on that issue: number one: people who use NFC all the time: people who use mobile payments, Google Wallet for that type of person. This is a deal breaker. This is not the phone for you if you're the other type of person like me, where you don't use NFC all that often I mean I used it actually, once in a while to pair with my rx100 to wirelessly transfer photos not a huge deal. It takes a little longer to do Wi-Fi pairing now, but for that it's not really a big deal. Oneplus is argument is that there are more of that second type of person, so they decided not to include it, but I mean how cheap would it have really been. I mean not including a super cheap feature like NFC and a new smartphone, because people don't use it is kind of like building a car and not including reverse lights, because people usually drive forward technically true but evade come on now. The camera. On the back of the oneplus 2, I did an entire separate video about that was when I first got the phone a few weeks ago and I'll link that video right below that like button, I can pair it at length to a couple of other high-end smartphones And give some photo and video quality samples. Basically, it's a pretty good quality. Smartphone camera, that's capable of taking some great shots, but it's a little slow and it needs to continue to be improved with software updates. It'S a 13 megapixel omni vision, pure cell s, image sensor, the largest pixel size of any 13 megapixel camera, and it has optical image stabilization and laser autofocus. The laser autofocus is very fast as you'd expect, and the optical image stabilization for photos is very good. It takes some crispy low-light shots with a low, slow, shutter, speed handheld. So that's awesome, but it's kind of slow to actually take the shot. Getting the camera app open is pretty quick. I'Ve been mapped to a double press of the home button, just like a Samsung phone, so I don't need any camera shortcut on my home screen, but the time it actually takes to click the photo and actually taking it is too long and it's that slow every Time kind of discouraging for when you're trying to capture faster motion, but I think we'll see this continued software update. It'S that make this phone and this camera better. It'S already gotten an update and soon apparently it's going to get manual controls as well. So this camera can get better and speaking of software, the oneplus 2 is running its own custom, rom of near stock, android, oxygen, OS 2.0 or actually 2.1. And i really like it, it's quick. It'S clean, it's pretty close to stock Android, as you can see, and it's customisable in a bunch of ways that are genuinely pretty useful. You can rearrange the icons of the toggles on your quick settings to look exactly how you want them and remove the ones that you don't use. You can go into the dual SIM card, tray settings and use one SIM card for calls, and the other one for data or really whatever you want. You can take total control of how the SIM cards are used or you can just use one you can use on screen or off screen buttons. I choose off screen and then, of course you can choose what the hardware buttons do on a long press or a double tap of any of the buttons. So that's how I made the DoubleTap of the middle home button open the camera, and I also have a long press of that home button open Google nap, but you can map a whole bunch more stuff for shortcuts. If you want - and you can enable a system-wide dark mode and change the accent color throughout the entire OS, which can be pretty nifty, there's tons of stuff like this, you can customize LED notification. Colors, you can customize app permissions, tweak, animation, speeds, etc. I mean you can really dig in and get your hands dirty and make this phone work exactly the way you want it to the biggest new feature. They'Ve added on the home screens that that looks like the furthest from stock Android is called shelf, which I guess everyone has to have a screen to the left of the home screens. Now so you can go into the settings and enable if you want - and it's basically just a page with a list of your recent apps frequent contacts and then some widgets of your choice. It'S kind of neat: you can change the header image to whatever you want and any widget in there you can add of any size. I'M not sure how many people will find this useful, but this is another one of those things that one plus can add features to with a software update. So I guess we can be optimistic about its potential and performance throughout all of oxygen. Os was top-notch snappy, as some might say. This is, of course, thanks to you the choice of your Snapdragon 810 chip, super high-end, your four gigabytes of RAM and, of course, a 1080p display not having to push as many pixels as a 1440p display. So I'm a fan, this usually tends to be the case with near stock Android phones, it handles a ram. Well, it remembers a ton of recent apps and multitasking and moving around between apps and web browsing, and your typical use is perfectly fine, as you'd expect, with higher end stuff. Like gaming, there was of course earlier concern about the Snapdragon 810, not being bad, but overheating, and this phone this phone never got hot on me once I gamed plenty, I put a lot of hours into it, even if it is throttling to keep temperatures down. I'M not noticing any difference in performance or functionality, and that's what really matters here. Battery life was also pretty good. This is combining, of course, the 3300 milliamp hour battery, which filled out the space nicely and the near stock Android experience and the great RAM management and the 1080p display instead of 2k. All the stuff combines to give my use an average of about three and a half to four hours or a little over four hours of screen on time per day, which the way I use a phone since I know it's different for everyone that number for me. I would give B, which is a huge improvement from like the d galaxy s6. I was using earlier, but also not quite at the level of the champs like the oneplus one and the Droid turbo. It'S enough to get me through an entire day comfortably, but not much past, that also there's no power saving mode. So once you get down to like 5 3 2 % of battery, you probably just want to turn it off. So, at the end of the day, when judging oneplus 2 as a complete package, it satisfies my like 5 pillars of a great smartphone package, pretty well great performance, great camera, great display, great battery life and great build quality and it kind of nails. All of those. Now I'm used to using like six seven $ 800 smartphones as my daily driver. So when you turn around and tell me, this is a $ 389 smartphone for this version, that's pretty damn impressive and I'm actually really curious to see how the Moto X style will come in and compare to this one at a pretty similar price point. All I can say is I've had my sim card in this phone for the past couple weeks like I've said, and I haven't wanted to take it out now sure as a full time user. You notice a lot of things. I don't even really see. In other reviews, like the vibration motor in this phone is really soft. It'S like really weak for some reasons. So if you leave your phone in vibrate only mode, I missed a couple calls that way and some notifications, which is weird and stuff like some apps like relay for reddit and Phoenix, didn't really work that well on this on until the latest version of oxygen OS 2.0.1, which fix a lot of that stuff and even stuff like the home button, not responding a hundred percent of the time, probably two percent of the time. It takes me an extra pressed for it to register. But again, a lot of this is nitpicking and can be fixed with continual software updates. So the worst thing about this phone is how hard it is to buy one again, but I would really recommend it to people who are willing to jump through a hoop or two or twelve to buy one thanks for watching guys and talk to you guys in The next one peace """
